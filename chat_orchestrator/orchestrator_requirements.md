## Overview

### Purpose
The PhilosopherOrchestrator is an enhanced backend system using Redis hybrid caching, state-driven conversations, and intelligent context management to generate dynamic philosophical dialogue experiences. The system maintains coherent conversations while intelligently managing context windows and philosophical datasets.

### Enhanced Architecture Principles
- **Redis-First Caching**: Master and chat datasets cached in Redis with MongoDB for persistence
- **State-Driven Conversations**: Dialogue flows through defined states with appropriate transitions
- **Intelligent Context Management**: Token-aware, relevance-scored content selection
- **Multi-Layer Meaning Extraction**: Surface, conceptual, intent, and emotional analysis
- **Coherence-First Updates**: Context changes maintain conversation flow integrity

## Enhanced System Architecture

### High-Level Flow with Redis
```
API Sources → Master Orchestrator → Redis (Master Dataset + TTL)
                                      ↓
User Input → Enhanced Meaning Extraction → Conversation State Machine
                                              ↓
Chat Orchestrator ← Redis (Session Data) → Context Intelligence
       ↓                                         ↓
Coherence Check → Prompt Generation → LLM → MongoDB (Conversation History)
```
