# Project Charter

## Project Name
Daemonium

## Project Summary
**Daemonium** is an AI-powered conversational platform that brings philosophy to life by enabling users to engage in dynamic, interactive discussions with historical philosophers. Users can explore complex ideas by theme, interact with individual thinkers, or observe debates between opposing viewpoints — all grounded in curated philosophical texts and AI-augmented reasoning. The platform blends deep learning, semantic search, and an immersive UX to create a thoughtful, educational, and unique experience in the AI chatbot space.

## Objectives
- Build a scalable foundation for philosophical dialogue via AI using structured philosophical knowledge
- Create a unique, engaging user experience through theme-based and persona-driven interactions
- Launch a functioning MVP with 3–4 philosophers and 3–4 core philosophical themes
- Design the system architecture to support voice interaction and advanced learning tools in future phases

## Success Criteria
- Completion of MVP with usable interface for theme/philosopher interaction
- Successful deployment of knowledge base and RAG-backed conversational engine
- Positive feedback from pilot testers regarding educational value and engagement
- Foundation in place to support future voice integration and expansion to more philosophers/themes
