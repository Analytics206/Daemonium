# ðŸ“˜ Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Name: Daemonium

## 1. Overview
**Daemonium** is a conversational AI platform that enables users to engage with philosophical ideas by interacting with simulated philosophers and thematic explorations. Designed for modularity, educational value, and long-term growth, the system will be containerized for reproducibility and local development. All components â€” including the LLM interface, vector/graph databases, data curation tools, and front-end â€” will run in a cohesive, maintainable architecture.

## 2. Goals
- Create an immersive, educational AI experience rooted in philosophy
- Use modular components to allow seamless switching between themes, philosophers, and models
- Maintain all code, curated data, and tools within a unified local-first development environment
- Support structured philosophical knowledge modeling using both vector and graph databases
- Future-proof the system for voice, user learning tracking, and extended philosophical content

## 4. Constraints
- Must prioritize open-access and public domain sources for content
- System should run entirely offline in development environments
- Preference for open-source components (e.g., Neo4j, Qdrant, HF models)

## 5. Assumptions
- User has access to moderate local compute resources
- Philosophical content can be chunked and interpreted using LLM + human QA
- Data curation can be aided by GPT-based automation and refined manually

## 6. Dependencies
- Embedding model availability (HuggingFace)
- Containerization toolchain (Docker, Docker Compose)
- Neo4j and Qdrant local installation
- GPT-4o or local LLM integration (via Ollama or similar)

## 7. Out of Scope (MVP)
- Multiplayer or social interaction features
- Paid subscriptions or monetization features
- Voice synthesis pipeline (planned post-MVP)
