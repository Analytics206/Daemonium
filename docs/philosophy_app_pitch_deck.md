## The Problem

### The Self-Help Crisis
- **$13.2B self-help market** delivering temporary fixes, not lasting transformation
- **Generic AI assistants** optimize for productivity, not human flourishing
- **Therapy chatbots** provide coping strategies, not wisdom frameworks

### What's Missing
People crave **meaning, wisdom, and authentic guidance** for life's big questions, but current solutions offer:
- ❌ Surface-level advice instead of deep understanding
- ❌ Prescribed answers instead of personal discovery
- ❌ Quick fixes instead of lasting transformation
- ❌ Generic solutions instead of personalized wisdom
