## 🛠 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Setting Up the Environment

#### Option 1: Using UV (Recommended)

1. Install UV (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # or
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # Production
   uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development
   ```

#### Option 2: Using pip

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # or
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Production
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development
   ```

### Running the Import Script

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose must be running
- Python environment with dependencies installed (see above)
- The PostgreSQL container (`daemonium-postgresql`) should be running

#### Using the Python Script (Cross-platform)

1. Ensure Docker is running and the PostgreSQL container is up:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgresql
   ```

2. Run the import script:
   ```bash
   # Basic usage (uses default CSV path: data/philosophers.csv)
   python scripts/import_philosophers.py
   
   # Or specify a custom CSV file
   python scripts/import_philosophers.py path/to/your/file.csv
   ```

#### Using the Batch File (Windows)

The batch file simplifies the process on Windows:

```batch
# From the project root
scripts\import_philosophers.bat
```

Or by double-clicking the batch file in Windows Explorer.

#### What the Script Does
1. Creates a temporary table in the database
2. Imports data from the CSV file
3. Updates existing records or inserts new ones based on the philosopher's name
4. Shows the number of records processed

#### Expected Output
```
Starting import from data/philosophers.csv
Added unique constraint on name column
Processed 2 philosopher records
- Socrates (ID: 1) - Updated: 2025-06-23 01:05:30.123456+00:00
- Plato (ID: 2) - Updated: 2025-06-23 01:05:30.123456+00:00
Import completed successfully
```

#### Troubleshooting
- If you get connection errors, ensure the PostgreSQL container is running
- Check that the CSV file exists at the specified path
- Verify the CSV format matches the expected columns: `name|dob|dod|summary|content|school_id|tag_id`

### Development Tools
- Format code: `black .`
- Sort imports: `isort .`
- Lint code: `pylint scripts/`
- Run tests: `pytest`

## 6. Optional: GPU-Accelerated Qdrant Setup on Remote Windows Machine

* For enhanced vector search performance, you can set up Qdrant with GPU acceleration on a separate Windows machine within the same network. This configuration is beneficial for:
- Processing large volumes of papers with faster embedding searches

### Quick Overview

a. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Windows 11 with WSL2 enabled
   - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.x support (8GB VRAM minimum)
   - 16GB RAM (32GB recommended)
   - IP address on your local network

b. **Setup Approach**:
   - Install WSL2 with Ubuntu
   - Configure CUDA in WSL2
   - Build Qdrant from source with GPU support
   - Configure for optimal performance with research paper embeddings


c. **Integration with NEW PROJECT NAME**:
   - After setup, update the Qdrant connection settings in your config/default.yaml
   - Run the pipeline as usual, with vector operations now GPU-accelerated

### Detailed Instructions
* Complete step-by-step instructions are available in the `qdrant_setup` directory:

```bash
```

#### The guide includes:
- Full installation procedures
- Configuration optimized for 768-dimensional embeddings (typical for research papers)
- Testing and benchmarking tools
- Maintenance and backup procedures
- Security recommendations

## Updating Configuration

* After setting up GPU-accelerated Qdrant, update your configuration:

```yaml

# In config/config.yaml

qdrant:
  host: "192.168.1.x"  # Replace with your Qdrant server's IP
  port: 6333
  collection_name: "arxiv_papers"

```

* **New Feature:** The sync_qdrant pipeline now includes **MongoDB tracking** to prevent duplicate processing of PDFs. Each processed PDF is recorded in the `vector_processed_pdfs` collection with metadata including file hash, processing date, and chunk count.

---

### Configuration

The application is configured using YAML files in the `config/` directory. The default configuration is in `config/default.yaml`.

Key configuration options:

## Recent Feature Additions
### 1. MongoDB Tracking for Qdrant Vector Processing
* The sync_qdrant pipeline now includes a tracking system to prevent duplicate processing and provide synchronization with Qdrant:

```yaml

# In config/config.yaml

qdrant:
  # ... other settings ...
  tracking:
    enabled: true # Whether to track processed PDFs
```

### This system:
- 

### 2. GPU Acceleration for Vector Operations
The pipeline now supports GPU acceleration for both:

#### A. Qdrant Vector Database
```yaml
# In config/config.yaml
qdrant:
  # ... other settings ...
  gpu_enabled: true # Enable GPU for vector operations
  gpu_device: 1 # GPU device index (0 for first GPU, 1 for second, etc.)
```

#### B. Standalone Qdrant with GPU
For better performance with large vector collections, you can run Qdrant as a standalone application with GPU support as documented in the "Qdrant Deployment Options" section.
---
## Ollama Integration (Optional)

The `sync_qdrant` pipeline uses [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) app for analyzing images extracted from PDFs if available:
- **What Ollama does**: Enhances the vector database by adding AI-generated descriptions of diagrams and figures in papers
- **Installation Options**:
  - **Desktop App**: Download and install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)
  - **Docker Container**: Run Ollama in a Docker container for easier integration with the ArXiv pipeline (see `docs/ollama_docker.md` for detailed instructions)
- **Required model**: Run `ollama pull llama3` to download the required model
- **Without Ollama**: The pipeline still functions normally without Ollama, but image descriptions will be placeholders

## NEW PROJECT NAME Configuration Settings

The system is configured through `config/config.yaml`. Key configuration sections included

### Important Note About PDF Paths in Docker

When running the `sync_qdrant` service in Docker, the PDF directory path specified in `config/config.yaml` is overridden by the volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml

# In docker-compose.yml

volumes:
  - E:/AI Research:/app/data/pdfs  # Maps Windows path to container path
```
Config changes take effect when services are restarted. See `docs/system_design.md` for detailed information about configuration impact on system behavior.

## Qdrant Deployment Options

This pipeline supports two options for running Qdrant (vector database):

### Option 1: Running Qdrant in Docker (Default)

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, we provide a pre-configured Qdrant container:

```yaml
qdrant:
  image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
  ports:
    - "6333:6333"
    - "6334:6334"
  volumes:
    - qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage
  restart: unless-stopped
```

### Option 2: Running Qdrant Locally with GPU Support

For better performance with large vector collections, you can run Qdrant as a standalone application with GPU acceleration:

1. **Download Qdrant** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases)
2. **Create a config file** at `config/qdrant_config.yaml` with GPU settings:

```yaml
storage:
  # Path to the directory where collections will be stored
  storage_path: ./storage
  # Vector data configuration with GPU support
  vector_data:
    # Enable CUDA support
    enable_cuda: true
    # GPU device index (0 for first GPU, 1 for second, etc.)
    cuda_device: 0
```

3. **Run Qdrant with the config**:

```
qdrant.exe --config-path config/qdrant_config.yaml
```

4. **Update the docker-compose.yml file** to comment out the Qdrant service but keep other services:
```yaml
# Comment out the Qdrant service
#qdrant:
#  image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
#  ...
# Update service connections to use host.docker.internal
app:
  environment:
    - QDRANT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:6333
```

## GPU Support for Embeddings Generation
1. **Install PyTorch with CUDA support**:
```bash

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

```

* Choose the appropriate CUDA version (cu118, cu121, etc.) based on your system. Check with `nvidia-smi`.

2. **Enable GPU in configuration**:
```yaml
# In config/config.yaml
qdrant:
  gpu_enabled: true  # Enable GPU for vector operations
  gpu_device: 0      # GPU device index (0 for first GPU)
```

3. **Verify GPU detection** by checking script output when running:
```

Using GPU for embeddings: cuda:0

```

## Notes

- **Python Versions**: 
  - Docker containers use `python:3.11-slim`
  - Local development 'requires' Python ≥3.11 as specified in pyproject.toml
  - All dependencies are managed through pyproject.toml for consistent environments

- **Data Persistence**:
  - All persistent data (MongoDB, Neo4j, Qdrant) is stored in Docker volumes or local directories
  - PDF files are stored in the configured local directory

- **Development Approach**:
  - Either use the Python virtual environment with `python -m` commands
  - Or use Docker Compose for containerized execution
  - Both methods use the same configuration and produce consistent results
  - Deveoper commonly uses both methods running in python env, docker compose and standalone databases

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymongo'`, ensure you have activated your virtual environment and installed dependencies.
- For Docker issues, ensure Docker Desktop is running and you have sufficient permissions.
