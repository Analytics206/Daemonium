Plato's Symposium is a philosophical dialogue exploring the nature of love (eros) through a series of speeches delivered at a drinking party in ancient Athens. The work presents multiple perspectives on love, building toward Plato's own philosophical understanding of desire and beauty.
Summary
The dialogue takes place at a symposium (drinking party) hosted by the tragic poet Agathon to celebrate his recent victory in a dramatic competition. The guests decide to give speeches praising Eros (Love) rather than drink heavily. Six speakers present their views: Phaedrus, Pausanias, Eryximachus, Aristophanes, Agathon, and Socrates. The dialogue concludes with the dramatic entrance of the drunken Alcibiades, who delivers a speech about Socrates himself.
Key Speeches and Ideas
Phaedrus presents love as the oldest and most honorable of gods, arguing that love inspires virtue and courage, particularly in military contexts where lovers fight more bravely to avoid shame before their beloved.
Pausanias distinguishes between two types of love: Common Love (purely physical attraction) and Heavenly Love (attraction to souls and minds). He argues that Heavenly Love, typically between an older man and younger man in Greek culture, is morally superior because it aims at virtue and wisdom.
Eryximachus takes a cosmic perspective, arguing that love is a universal principle governing harmony in medicine, music, astronomy, and all natural phenomena. He sees love as the force that brings order from chaos.
Aristophanes delivers the famous myth of soulmates, describing how humans were originally spherical beings with four arms, four legs, and two faces. Zeus split them in half as punishment for their pride, and now each person seeks their other half, explaining the intensity of romantic longing.
Agathon praises love as the youngest, most beautiful, and most virtuous of gods, possessing all good qualities and inspiring them in others.
Socrates reports a conversation with Diotima, a wise woman who taught him about love. She argues that love is neither beautiful nor ugly, good nor bad, but rather a desire for beauty and goodness that one lacks. Love is a daimon (spirit) that mediates between mortals and gods.
The Ladder of Love
Diotima's teaching culminates in the famous "ladder of love" - a progression from lower to higher forms of love:

Love of a beautiful body
Love of all beautiful bodies
Love of beautiful souls
Love of beautiful institutions and laws
Love of beautiful knowledge and sciences
Love of Beauty itself - the Form of Beauty

This ascent represents the philosopher's journey from physical attraction to the contemplation of absolute Beauty, which Plato identifies with the Good and Truth.
Central Themes
The Nature of Desire: Love is fundamentally about lack and longing - we desire what we don't possess. This connects to Plato's broader philosophy about the soul's relationship to truth and beauty.
The Relationship Between Physical and Spiritual: The dialogue explores how physical attraction can be a starting point for spiritual and intellectual development, though the highest forms of love transcend the merely physical.
Immortality and Creativity: Love drives humans to create - whether through procreation, artistic works, or philosophical insights - as a way to achieve a kind of immortality.
Knowledge and Virtue: True love leads to wisdom and virtue. The lover of beauty becomes beautiful; the lover of wisdom becomes wise.
Philosophical Significance
The Symposium presents Plato's theory that philosophical contemplation is the highest form of love. The dialogue suggests that erotic energy, properly directed, becomes the driving force behind the philosopher's search for truth. This connects to Plato's broader metaphysical system where the material world is a reflection of eternal Forms, and love is what draws the soul toward ultimate reality.
The work also demonstrates Plato's literary skill, using the dramatic setting and diverse characters to explore complex philosophical ideas through vivid personalities and memorable myths, making abstract concepts accessible and emotionally resonant.
