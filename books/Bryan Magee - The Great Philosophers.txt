any attempt to tell the story of western philosophy must begin with the ancient greeks who produced not only the first
0:43
but some of the greatest western philosophers the one whose name is probably most familiar is socrates who died in the
0:50
year 399 bc but there were several outstanding greek philosophers before him some of whose
0:57
names are also widely known for example pythagoras and heraclitus there were
1:02
others too of comparable caliber the first one of all being thales who flourished in the 6th century bc
1:10
if all these pre-socratic philosophers can be said to have had one common concern it was an attempt to find
1:17
universal principles which would explain the whole of nature in today's terms they were as much
1:22
concerned with what we would call science as with what we would call philosophy
1:28
now socrates was in conscious rebellion against their tradition he maintained that what we most need to
1:34
learn is not how nature works but how we ourselves ought to live and therefore
1:40
that we need first and foremost to consider moral questions socrates didn't write anything he did
1:47
all his teaching by word of mouth and none of the writings of any of the pre-socratic philosophers have come down
1:53
to us directly so all that we know of any of the philosophers who've names i've mentioned so far is what has come
2:00
down to a second hand through the writings of others though this does include some pretty long summaries and a
2:06
good many direct quotations the first philosopher who wrote works which we actually now possess complete
2:14
was plato he was a pupil of socrates and in fact it's from plato's writings that most of
2:20
our knowledge of socrates derives in his own right however plato was beyond any question one of the greatest
2:27
philosophers of all time some think the greatest so if we have to choose an arbitrary
2:33
starting point in what is after all a continuous story then in many ways a good one is the year 399 bc with the
2:42
death of socrates and then the subsequent writings of plato
2:47
plato was about 31 when socrates died and lived to be 81
2:52
during that half century he founded his famous school in athens the academy which was the prototype of what we call
2:59
a university and he produced his writings nearly all of which take the form of dialogues with
3:05
different arguments being put in the mouths of different characters one of whom nearly always is socrates
3:12
most though not all of these dialogues are called by the name of one of the people socrates is talking to in them
3:18
thus we have the fido the lekis the euthyphro the theaters the parmenides
3:26
the timaeus and so on there are more than two dozen of them some of them 20 some 80 a couple of them 300 pages long
3:34
the most famous of all are probably the republic and the symposium but most of them are easily available
3:40
nowadays in paperback translations the best are regarded as works of literature
3:45
great works of literature as well as a philosophy plato was an artist as well as a thinker and many people regard his
3:52
prose as the finest greek prose ever to have been written by anyone with me now is one of the acknowledged
3:59
experts on plato in the english-speaking world the professor of ancient philosophy in the university of
4:04
cambridge miles bernierte professor bernat i know that you regard plato's
4:09
career as a creative philosopher as having been somehow launched by socrates
4:14
is death how was that well i think socrates death in 399 must have been a
4:22
traumatic event for a lot of people socrates had been this spellbinding
4:28
presence around in athens for many many years much loved much hated he'd been on
4:34
caricatured on the comic stage then suddenly this familiar figure's not
4:39
there anymore and he's not there because i mean this is the must have been the
4:45
most traumatic thing he's been condemned to death on a charge of impiety and
4:51
corrupting the young well he'd had a lot of followers
4:56
and some of them amongst them plato began writing socratic dialogues
5:03
conversations philosophical conversations in which socrates takes the lead must have been
5:09
like a chorus of voices saying to the athenians look he's not gone after all he's still here still asking those
5:15
awkward questions still tripping up with his arguments and of course they were
5:20
also defending his reputation and showing he'd been unjustly condemned he was the great educator of the young not
5:27
the great corrupter but the death of socrates wasn't just said to speak a launching pad for plato
5:33
was it it the whole of plato's outlook can in one sense be explained with reference to
5:38
socrates can it not i think it can um the
5:43
to keep alive the socratic spirit for plato meant to go on doing
5:49
philosophy in the way socrates had done to
5:55
so what you get is a group of early dialogues in which he is basically showing socrates discussing the sorts of
6:02
questions he was interested in very largely moral questions but since to do philosophy in the socratic
6:10
way means to do it by thinking philosophically the process
6:16
bit by bit and inevitably leads plato to develop his own ideas in a host of other
6:22
areas so that socrates there's a sort of evolution in the picture of socrates from the gadfly
6:28
questioner of the early dialogues he gradually turns into the man who's expounding political
6:33
theories metaphysical theories and so on in the middle period dialogues menos symposium fido and republic and i
6:40
suppose also one can say that in the early dialogues plato is dealing with subjects that interested socrates and
6:46
dealing them with them in socrates's way and is then carried so to speak by his own momentum as the years go by into
6:53
dealing with subjects that interest him plato and beginning to deal with them in a different way i think that's right
7:00
wherever he can plausibly present the ideas as the outgrowth of thinking about
7:05
socrates's ideas they get put in the mouth of socrates and i think it's very important to
7:12
that what he the way he presents socrates the historical claim he makes about him is
7:17
this is a man who thought for himself and taught others to think for themselves so if you want to be a
7:23
follower of socrates that means thinking for yourself and if necessary departing from ideas and areas that
7:30
socrates had marked out now there's early dialogues where socrates is dealing with moral questions all have a
7:36
certain common pattern don't they i mean what happens in nearly all of them is that socrates is talking to some
7:42
interlocutor who thinks he knows the meaning of some very familiar term like friendship or
7:48
courage or piety or something of that kind and by simply quizzing him by
7:55
interrogating him by submitting him to what's become known as socratic questioning
8:00
socrates shows this person and incidentally the onlookers as well that they don't at all have a clear
8:06
grasp of this concept that they thought they understood so well now this process has itself been of
8:13
enormous importance in philosophy ever since hasn't it not only has it been but these very
8:20
works are still very widely used to teach philosophy and to introduce
8:25
philosophy to people who want to know something about it you start with
8:31
a familiar and important concept it's always a concept that's important in our
8:36
life and you get people to realize that there are problems in that
8:42
concept they try to think about it they produce an answer socrates shows the inadequacy of the answer you end up
8:50
not with a firm answer but with a much better grasp of the problem than you had before
8:58
and you the reader 20th century reader or an ancient reader
9:03
are left both drawn into the problem and wanting to get the answer and feeling that perhaps you can contribute
9:09
i can't help reflecting that even after more than 2000 years we're still puzzling about the meaning of terms like
9:16
beauty or courage or friendship we're still wondering precisely what these things consist of have we got any
9:24
further after all this time yes and no must be the answer wasn't it um i think plato would
9:31
very be very firmly insistent that even if he did know the
9:36
answer if he told us it wouldn't do us any good i mean it's the nature of these questions that they are ones that you
9:43
have to think about for yourself and an answer is worth nothing unless it's come
9:48
through your own thinking and that's why these dialogues are so successful as instruments for drawing you into
9:54
philosophy in those early dialogues that we're still for the moment confining ourselves
9:59
to one thing that socrates keeps saying is that he has no positive doctrines of his
10:06
own to teach that all he's doing is asking people questions but there seems
10:11
to be something disingenuous about this claim on socrates is part i think that in fact there are
10:17
so to speak unacknowledged doctrines lying under the surface of these dialogues would you agree with
10:22
that well there are some doctrines that emerge
10:28
not very many um there is a group of ideas
10:35
which comes out in the apology for instance when he says that to a good man
10:40
no harm can come either during his life or after his death and which comes out
10:46
in the gorgeous when he argues at great length that injustice
10:52
harms the doer and justice benefits the doer it's the idea that
10:59
there is no real harm that can come to you you lose your money stricken by paralyzed by disease
11:06
none of that rarely counts as harm only the loss of your virtue would
11:12
count it only going in for bad practices like injustice they would be the only
11:18
real harm because the only real harm is harm to the soul there's a group of ideas which his socrates is very
11:24
emphatic about where he sometimes even claims to have knowledge and it's also a group of ideas where
11:30
plato never reneges on socrates he remains convinced of the truth of the proposition that injustice harms the
11:37
doer and justice benefits him and that's provided your soul remains untouched worldly misfortunes don't do
11:44
you any harm of any really deep significance that's right yes there's another group of ideas
11:51
which socrates where socrates does not claim knowledge and where plato eventually is going to renege on
11:57
socrates and that's the group of ideas summed up in the statement that virtue is knowledge
12:03
in these dialogues when somebody's asked what's courage what's friendship what's
12:08
justice sooner or later as the discussion proceeds the idea emerges
12:14
that this virtue courage or party should be regarded as a kind of knowledge
12:20
and that's just as strong and paradoxical statement as the first group of ideas
12:26
because common sense and i mean common sense then as now ordinarily supposes that it's one thing
12:33
to have the wisdom to know what the best thing to do in a given situation is
12:38
but another thing which you also need the courage to carry it out if it's difficult or the temperance to resist an
12:45
easier option instead wisdom's one virtue one quality to
12:51
admire in a person courage is another and a man may have one and not the other or dif
12:56
each of them to different degrees but if courage just is this knowledge then that kind of contrast can't arise
13:04
if i don't do the right thing it can't be that i knew what i should do
13:10
but lacked the courage to carry it out i just if i lack the courage i lacked the knowledge and i didn't know what the
13:16
right thing to do was so any wrongdoing that i do
13:21
is done in ignorance because i didn't know it wasn't the best thing to do
13:26
and if done in ignorance done involuntarily so no one does wrong
13:31
willingly is the famous way it's summed up doesn't the unvarying dialogue form
13:38
that plato writes in give rise to two rather important and also really
13:43
unnecessary problems first to what extent is this the
13:48
historical socrates whose views are being put before us and to what extent is he a kind of fictional
13:54
character created by plato because after all these dialogues were written after socrates's death
14:01
and the other question perhaps related to that is what are the authors own views because again since these are all
14:09
dialogues it means that all opinions are put into the mouth of other characters
14:14
and that sometimes at least leaves us feeling that we're not quite sure what plato himself actually thinks
14:22
well i think there's a sense in which we need to worry about this question and in a sense in which we
14:27
don't the sense in which we don't is that plato's portrait of socrates makes the
14:34
claim here is a man who thought for himself and would overthrow long cherished
14:40
conclusions if it turned out that he thought they were wrong and he taught others to do the same
14:46
so if plato comes to think that there is more to virtue than knowledge though
14:52
knowledge remains the most important factor and he does come to think this then it's only
14:58
in keeping with the socratic spirit to throw over the doctrine that virtue is
15:03
knowledge and produce a better view of his own the other side of the coin is of course
15:09
it's most important that we notice what's happening when socrates in the republic says something incompatible
15:15
with what socrates said in the protagoras notice that we're getting a new view and how it
15:21
connects with all the other concerns of the republic how it makes a much more complicated picture of moral education
15:27
and how it makes possible a new vision of a political ideal society
15:33
the important thing is the search and the inquiry but it's got to be inquiry search with understanding of
15:39
where we've got to from where yes in other words because our assumptions and in beliefs and so on are open to
15:46
perpetual questioning conclusions in quotation marks don't have any special status they're they are
15:53
themselves staging posts on the road to further inquiries that's i think what plato believed very strongly
15:59
and so he's in a way demonstrating this to us by his practice exactly and i
16:04
think he would claim that that was what it was to keep the socratic spirit alive yeah perpetual question
16:10
[Music] it's usual isn't it to divide plato's output into three periods
16:17
happen so often with writers and even creative artists the early the middle and the later
16:23
and so far in this discussion we've been confining ourselves to consideration of the early dialogues when you move to the
16:29
middle period plato dialogues you find plato for the first time beginning to
16:34
put forward positive ideas of his own not socrates's but plato's own ideas and
16:40
to argue for those ideas which would you say are the most important of plato's
16:46
positive doctrines i think one has to single out two above
16:51
all the theory of forms and the doctrine that learning is recollection the idea
16:57
that to learn something is to recover from within your mind recesses
17:04
knowledge that you had before you were born let me take that one first of the two i think a lot of people will think
17:10
when they first hear this that we are born knowing things that might sound a bit bizarre but at least very closely
17:17
related ideas to that have been permanent in our western culture i mean idealist philosophers have thought there
17:24
was innate knowledge or innate ideas most of the religions i think believe something of the sort
17:30
and we even have eminent contemporary thinkers like chomsky believing that you're born with a whole grammar
17:36
programmed into your mind now what was plato's version of this belief
17:41
plato's version was that this knowledge was part of the essential nature of the
17:46
soul which the soul possessed before you were born because he believes at this period
17:52
in the soul existing before it's embodied in this world
17:59
i think to understand this theory um one's got to go back to those early
18:05
socratic discussions uh if you look at one of these early discussions
18:10
somebody is asked for a definition of let's say courage and
18:15
lekis who's the person who's asked that says at one point courage is endurance
18:21
socrates then asks him some further questions and he always does this when he's been given a definition he says is
18:28
courage invariably a fine and admirable quality yes says lekis
18:34
and then socrates takes him through a number of examples of endurance where endurance is not admirable at all
18:41
maybe very fool-hearted pig-headedness or it may just be morally neutral as when a some financer keeps on
18:49
spending money enduring the losses because he knows he's going to get a profit at the end so if endurance is
18:55
morally neutral or bad carriages and courage is always good then
19:01
courage can't be endurance that's a typical pattern of socratic discussion
19:08
logically all that's actually happened is leki's has been shown that his
19:13
beliefs are inconsistent if we take all the answers together they can't all be right because they contradict each other
19:19
but socrates always presents the situation there's one in which that definition encourages
19:25
endurance has been refuted so that he is in practice taking leki's secondary answers as
19:33
either true or somehow nearer the truth than the definition and hence available as a basis for refuting the definition
19:41
and saying that's the one that's got to go can i just uh stop you there because i think you've said something that's of
19:46
great importance to us all today i think we all tend to have this assumption that
19:51
by discussion you can get at the truth whereas almost by definition discussion can't necessarily do that all it can the
19:58
most it can show you is that your conclusions are consonant with your premises but of course if there's
20:04
something wrong with the premises then there'll be something wrong with the conclusion well we are very attached to
20:09
this idea and if you think about it it's actually quite hard to justify socrates doesn't try to justify
20:16
it he just does this and says we've now refuted the definition but if one had to give a theory of what he's doing
20:23
then one would have to say something like what i've just said and you've just implied that we all have within us the
20:30
means for making the truth vanquish the force and that's exactly what plato does in
20:37
the meno he produces as it were a theory of socratic or philosophical discussion
20:44
which puts forward the suggestion that we all have latent within our minds the
20:50
correct answers to these questions what is courage what is justice and so on and it's that knowledge deep back within not
20:58
immediately accessible that knowledge is what enables us to knock down all the wrong answers and
21:04
show they're wrong and that knowledge is gradually emerging bit by bit in the
21:09
course of that bit of discussion where for instance one thing that leki's says is used to
21:16
show that some other thing that leki says must be false now i know that uh in your view
21:23
the doctrine you've just expanded for us ties up directly with what the basis is
21:28
for plato's most famous doctrine of all the theory of forms that doctrine must
21:34
have been the most influential part of his philosophy in the whole history of philosophy in fact it's what the word
21:40
platonism has historically almost come to mean now can you explain that to us
21:47
well remember that these discussions which socrates has are all centered on a
21:53
definitional question what is the definition of courage of beauty of justice
22:00
if now we have latent within ourselves the knowledge
22:07
of the answers to those questions and we have that knowledge independently of and
22:13
prior to our experience of the world we live in are using our senses and going
22:19
around from place to place we our knowledge is prior to that independent of that then
22:24
surely what we know justice beauty
22:30
courage must itself be independent of and prior to
22:36
this empirical world we're now existing in and that thesis is the fundamental assertion of
22:42
the theory of forms that justice beauty and the like exist independently of
22:49
and prior to all the just actions just people all the
22:54
beautiful things statues objects any you can find beauty and justice exist on their own
23:01
and apart that's the theory of forms this theory that there is another world
23:07
than this uh an ideal world which is not this world but in which
23:13
everything exists that actually gives value and meaning to this world has had
23:18
incalculable influence on the whole of our culture hasn't it yes it's had immense influence on christianity for
23:24
example i don't want to go into that now because i think we ought to stick to the philosophy but that's just one example
23:30
of the enormous influence that it's had yes yes and
23:36
but i think one should be careful of using phrases like the the world of forms or another
23:43
world plato uses them but the contrast he has in mind is not as one might have thought
23:50
a contrast between one set of particular things and then another one completely like it except
23:55
more perfect more abstract somewhere else some heaven somewhere his contrast is between the particular
24:01
and the general those questions what is justice what is beauty are general questions they're not
24:09
questions about the here and now and that's the contrast there's a point in the fido where socrates is saying that
24:16
to do philosophy is to rehearse for death it is in fact to practice being dead
24:24
why well because being dead is having one soul separate from the body and not
24:29
considering the things of this world and in doing philosophy you are as far as you can separating the soul from the
24:36
party because you're not thinking about the here and now if you're asking what's justice
24:41
anywhere anytime justice in itself you're not asking who did me wrong now
24:47
yesterday if you're asking what's beauty you're not asking who's the most beautiful person in this room and if
24:53
you're not thinking about the here and now then in the sense plate is interested in
24:59
you're not here and now you are where your mind is not because you're in some other particular place but a better one
25:06
but because you're not in that in place in that sense at all you're immersed in generalities so
25:13
it's all right to use the phrase the world of forms subject to the qualification that that
25:18
means the realm of invariable generalities yeah so the word world here is actually misleading we
25:25
mustn't think of it as a place right where certain spiritual things subsist
25:30
right yes yeah now these middle period dialogues that we're talking about now i'm thinking
25:36
particularly of the the meno the fido the republic the symposium the fedris
25:42
these were written by plato when he was absolutely at the height of his powers went there and i think this is actually
25:48
a good point for us to pause for a moment and think of their literary and aesthetic qualities
25:54
why are these dialogues regarded and always have been regarded as supreme
26:00
works of literary art why is that so they're so alive i mean a lot of other philosophers have
26:06
tried writing dialogues both ancient and modern xenophon cicero augustine barkley and hume
26:14
but the only one of those ones i've just named who comes anywhere near plato is hume
26:19
and i think this is because for hume like plato it's the process of philosophical thinking that counts at
26:26
least as much as the answers with xenophon or barkley it's all too clear you're reading somebody who cares
26:32
about the answers not the process of journeying towards them
26:39
where plato is concerned we have to add his fantastic mastery of language
26:44
whether it's high flow and imaginative descriptions or witty reparty jokes
26:50
images he's terribly good at making crystal clear the most difficult thoughts
26:57
you can go on adding i mean because in the end it's just that he's a artistic genius as well
27:02
as a philosophical one do you share the uh traditional view that his masterpiece is the republic yes i do why
27:11
i think because it's in the republic more than anywhere else that he makes good his belief that
27:18
every question is connected with every other and that the inquiry really can't stop
27:23
that even a conclusion for now leads on to the next problem i mean you you begin
27:30
with a straightforward question what is justice familiar socratic kind of question that becomes
27:38
the question is justice a benefit to its possessor
27:44
and socrates sets out and this is really the task of the whole republic to show that justice is a benefit to its
27:51
possessor indeed the thing you need most of all if you're to be happy whereas the unjust man is the most miserable of all
27:57
creatures but to do that it turns out he has to give a theory of human nature
28:03
he divides the soul into three parts and this is where he reneges on socrates thesis that
28:09
virtue is knowledge virtue turns out to involve more than knowledge their knowledge must be in
28:15
control and with the idea that knowledge is something that can and should be in
28:20
control of the non-rational factors you also get the idea which that but now
28:26
becomes possible of a of a society in which knowledge was in control
28:32
so we get a whole political theory of a new better way of life in society
28:39
all this emphasis on knowledge being in control raises the question what knowledge and what is knowledge
28:45
anyway and why is it better than an opinion so you've got a theory of knowledge the question what knowledge
28:50
the philosophers need in order to rule the rest of us becomes
28:55
an inquiry into the sciences there's a lot about mathematics a whole vision of
29:02
understanding the world as it is that we live in is produced in order to support the claim
29:09
that this understanding of the world as it is is what should be in charge of ourselves both individually and
29:16
in society and so all of that growing out of this one
29:21
question what is justice the inquiry really doesn't cease until death
29:27
with the vision of the afterlife and the myth of air at the end of the book it's such a rich book that i think we can't go any
29:34
further in pursuing individual strands within it i think one must just hope that some of the people listening to the
29:39
discussion will be prompted by it to go off and have a look at it for themselves i think we must
29:45
move on now to the later dialogues of plato and when we do when the move from
29:50
the middle to the late period of plato's output shows us another change of character again
29:57
suddenly the dialogues become less literary dramatic colorful etc
30:03
and rather more what we might call academic or analytic why is that
30:10
in my view they're not actually less dramatic what happens is that all the
30:16
effort of irony and imagery that in previous works went into depicting
30:22
the people undertaking the discussion that's all now going to the ideas and arguments themselves and very often it's
30:29
ideas and arguments that are familiar to us from plato's own earlier works like
30:34
the republic or the fido plato i mean one of these extraordinary things
30:40
about plato and he may have been the first writer in history to be able to do this is he built up a
30:47
relationship with his readers such that when writing one work he can take it for
30:52
granted that his readers have read his previous works he can surprise them he can make illusions he can build up
30:58
resonances through that and what he most of all does with that
31:04
is conduct a sort of public self-scrutiny of his own earlier ideas
31:09
relying on us the readers to know what they are but saying so to speak don't get too
31:16
enthused by the fedo and the republic it was all very fine stuff i know
31:21
but these truths if they were are no good to you or to me if we can't defend them against
31:29
criticism and maybe they weren't truth anyway maybe they were all wrong so let's take a few of them and
31:36
subject them to really hard analytical criticism now if you had to single out one of
31:42
these later dialogues for particular mention which would you choose well the prime example is the parmenides
31:48
where the tables are turned on socrates socrates puts forward the theory of
31:54
forms as he stated it in the fido and is unmistakably the fido there are various verbal connections
32:00
with the feeder that plato clearly expects his reader to pick up and say to himself gosh the socrates of the fedo is
32:07
now on the receiving end of the questions and in fact old pamenides who
32:12
is talking to socrates in this dialogue produces a series of objections and criticisms of the theory of forms
32:18
which many philosophers from arizona onwards have thought were quite devastating and plato doesn't tell us the answer
32:25
he produces the criticisms and you're left to decide for yourself whether they're fair unfair and if they're fair what
32:33
you're to do about the theory of forms one of the dialogues which some people think is late others think is one of the
32:39
middle period ones that doesn't matter which stands aside from the rest is the
32:45
timaeus isn't it partly because it actually contains more cosmology and
32:50
science than it does philosophy but mostly i think because it also contains a wonderfully poetic
32:57
creation myth not not not dissimilar actually to the one in the book of genesis that i think
33:03
we're all familiar with now why did plato do that i mean what i have in mind
33:09
in asking the question is this do you think for example he believed it literally in the way one must assume i
33:15
suppose that the ancient hebrews literally believe in the book of genesis
33:20
i myself think he did not believe it literally the the question was controversial in ancient times but
33:27
plato's closest associates took the view that
33:32
plato presented a narrative of the divine craftsman imposing order on chaos
33:40
meaning this to be a vivid way of presenting an analysis of what he took to be the fundamental
33:47
constituents of the whole universe that he wanted to see the entire universe as a product of order imposed on disorder
33:55
and particularly mathematical order and that of course is something very different from genesis the divine
34:00
craftsman is embodying above all mathematical intelligence in the world at large so
34:08
it's a poetic way of explaining the intelligibility of the world which has been a mystery for people
34:14
actually from the earliest times until now right and of course
34:19
such a general proposition as the proposition that the whole universe is the product of imposing order on
34:26
disorder isn't a proposition that you can prove either in general or in
34:31
all its vast detailed ramifications and plato is very well aware of this and that's another aspect i think
34:38
for another reason why he puts it forward as a myth but a myth which
34:45
is the guiding inspiration of something that plato was very serious about that's a research program
34:52
in which he enlisted at the academy all the leading mathematicians of his day
34:58
every advance in mathematical astronomy mathematical harmonics even a medical
35:03
theory which shows disease and health to be a matter of the proportions between
35:08
the constituent elements in the body each such step forward is a further proof of something plato cared deeply
35:15
about the idea that mathematical regularities and harmonies and proportions
35:21
are what's what explain things and these mathematical harmonism proportions are
35:27
for plato the prime examples of goodness and beauty so
35:33
really this is a vision for a scientific research program which is to show that
35:40
goodness and beauty are the fundamental explanatory factors in the world at large what you're saying now makes me wonder
35:46
how all this ties up with the republic because when you were talking about the republic a few minutes ago one of the
35:52
things you stressed was that that is in a sense a complete philosophy well now how does what plato is saying
36:00
in the timaeus fit into that apparently already complete philosophy
36:05
well i think it fits it like a hand fits into a glove in that what you have in
36:11
the republic is a sketch of a program
36:16
for a scientific above all or mathematically scientific understanding of nature
36:22
which plato begins to carry out or do his share of in the tamiyas
36:28
and indeed it's the timeis which people
36:35
went to as the statement of plato's philosophy for a very long time and it's really
36:42
only a more recent development which has taken the republic to be the work of plato that you go and
36:48
read for a long time it was the time of year so what you're saying is that all that cosmology and science in the in the
36:54
times or you say time as i say times uh taught in different schools uh all
37:00
that cosmology and science is the working out in practice of possibilities that were canvassed in
37:07
the republic yes and the tamirs presents itself dramatically in its introduction
37:12
as a continuation in some sense of the discussion in the republic
37:18
and what's more this research program as i called it that's
37:25
announced in the republic as to how astronomy should be done how
37:31
mathematical harmonics should be done was actually done and behind that
37:36
academic research program is i mean that is the starting point of
37:42
many of the very greatest achievements of greek mathematical science down to the astronomy of ptolemy
37:48
ptolemy's astronomy is the ultimate descendant of the astronomy that was
37:54
done in the academy by these leading mathematicians that plato
37:59
gathered together there to show us a world where mathematical order
38:06
is the governing principle that's the most important must feature most importantly in your
38:13
science and since mathematical order is the expression for plato of goodness
38:19
and beauty these sciences which show us the world as it is
38:25
objectively speaking are simultaneously sciences of value and that's how the
38:32
metaphysical aspects of the republic this knowledge that the philosophers
38:38
are to learn can simultaneously be the foundation for a radical new kind of politics because
38:44
what the philosophers are learning before they come to rule the rest of us are sciences of value as well as fact
38:53
another of the dialogues another of the later dialogues that you yourself have a particular
38:59
reputation of the knowing about in the academic world as the theaters
39:04
why have you specialized in that because i find it endlessly
39:10
exciting and i've never plumbed to the bottom every time i go back back to it
39:16
this seems to be more to to discover about it and i think many philosophers have found this is the
39:22
dialogue that leibniz translated barclay wrote quite a lot about wittgenstein
39:27
quoted this is a dialogue which other philosophers have always found stimulating what's it about
39:33
the question is what is knowledge and it's a large-scale exercise of the
39:40
kind of socratic discussion that went on in the early dialogues but on a much bigger grander scale three
39:47
answers are given knowledge is perception knowledge is true judgment knowledge is
39:52
true judgment together with an account each of those answers is knocked down in
39:59
true socratic style we're not told what plato thinks knowledge is at the end
40:05
but we have learnt such an enormous amount about the problem and about the ramifications of the
40:11
problem that we go away feeling the richer rather than the poorer there's no
40:16
consensus to this day on what the precise nature of knowledge is but i guess that the nearest
40:22
we have to a generally accepted view is actually close to what you just said namely that it's
40:28
perception something that's based on direct experience plus
40:33
our capacity to provide justification for it ah you've now produced
40:39
an interesting solution to the problem we're left with at the end of the dialogue namely all of
40:46
those answers have been knocked down taken separately it's been socrates has refuted the
40:53
thesis that knowledge is perception refuted the thesis that knowledge is true judgment refuted thesis the true
40:58
judgment is that knowledge is true judgment with an account and now you're suggesting that perhaps we could get
41:04
a definition of knowledge by somehow putting all the elements of the three
41:10
separate definitions together into one and thereby making a theory of knowledge
41:16
um around a definition of knowledge that would be a highly
41:22
suitable response to this kind of dialogue namely suggesting a definition of one's own in
41:28
terms of what one's learned from the dialogue we must i think bring this discussion to
41:33
a close now but before we do i would like to ask you something about the influence of all this because plato must
41:42
be either the most influential or one of the two or three most influential philosophers there have ever been
41:49
can you say a little if only briefly about what the main lines of this influence have been
41:54
i think it's important to remember there were two philosophies
42:01
opposed to materialism in the ancient world there was materialism in the form of the atomic doctrine held by
42:07
democritus and epicurus and there were the anti-materialist philosophers plato and aristotle both of
42:15
whom are opposed to the suggestion that everything life order mind civilization art nature
42:24
can all be explained as the outcome of the movements of particles of matter subject just to the laws of motion and
42:31
their own nature now aristotelianism is opposed to that sort
42:36
of materialism but aristotelianism carries the war so far into the enemy camp that is actually very hard to
42:43
reconcile the aristotelian philosophy with the modern scientific enterprise which has a
42:49
lot about atoms and the movements of particles of matter and all that sort of stuff
42:55
and indeed i think it was no accident that when the modern scientific enterprise got going it got going by
43:01
throwing away the aristotelianism which had so dominated the middle ages but
43:07
platonism is much easier to reconcile with the modern scientific
43:14
enterprise and that's why i think since the renaissance really platonism
43:21
has lived on after the death of aristotelianism because that's a philosophy which you
43:28
can use or be influenced by if you're seeking to show how scientific
43:34
and spiritual values can be reconciled if you want to do justice to the complexities of things
43:41
where materialism is giving just too simple and simplistic a story and there's something very contemporary to
43:46
us isn't there about the fact that plato's cosmology and plato science is based on an essentially mathematical
43:53
physics yes thank you very much professor bernier thank you
Martha Nussbaum on Aristotle
43:59
our view of the philosophy of the ancient world is dominated by two figures plato and aristotle
44:05
plato is the first philosopher whose works have come down to us in the form in which he wrote them aristotle was one
44:11
of his pupils in fact there's an extraordinary line of personal succession there for just as
44:17
aristotle had been a pupil of plato so plato had been a pupil of socrates
44:22
in this program we're going to look at aristotle's work whose greatness and influence rival those of any other
44:28
philosophers the son of a doctor aristotle was born in 384 bc not in athens but he was sent
44:35
to athens to be educated and at the age of 17 he became one of the pupils at plato's academy
44:42
he stayed there for 20 years until the death of plato in 347 bc
44:48
he was then uprooted and spent the next 12 years in political exile a period in which he was primarily absorbed in
44:54
biological researches and even spent a short period as tutor to alexander the great
45:00
he then returned to athens and for another 12 years taught at a school which he founded himself called the
45:05
lyceum then he went into exile again but died only a year later in 322 bc at the
45:12
age of 62. only about one-fifth of aristotle's work has survived
45:18
but even that fills 12 volumes and touches on the whole range of what was available knowledge in his time
45:25
unfortunately all those works which he prepared for publication and which were praised throughout antiquity for their
45:31
great beauty of style have been lost all we have is what he wrote up from lecture notes so it has none of the
45:38
literary art of what we have of plato's writings but even so there can be no doubt the
45:44
quality or the influence of the thought here to discuss it with me is someone who established a reputation very young
45:51
in aristotle scholarship professor martha nussbaum of brown university in the united states
45:57
professor nusbaum can you start by telling us something about the ground covered by aristotle's output yes we
46:04
have here a philosophical achievement of tremendous range and complexity we have fundamental work in all the sciences of
46:10
his day including especially the science of biology where his contribution was unmatched for a thousand years then work
46:17
in general foundations of scientific explanation general philosophy of nature work in metaphysics including questions
46:23
of substance identity continuity work on life and the mental faculties
46:29
and finally we have terrific work in ethics and political theory and work in rhetoric and the theory of literature
46:35
it's an extraordinary fact isn't it that over this incomparable range he was regarded as the authority for hundreds
46:41
upon hundreds of years during the middle ages yes and i think this actually gives us a great difficulty in approaching
46:47
aristotle's thought we're so used to thinking of him as you say as an authority as the philosopher dante's the
46:53
master of those who know sitting on his throne and i think actually this prevents us from seeing that aristotle
47:00
is really one of the most flexible and open-ended of philosophers one who views philosophy as an ongoing search to
47:06
attend to all the complexities of human experience and who never rests content and but is searching for
47:12
ever more adequate ways to bring that complexity into his thought now across the enormous range of his output is
47:18
there any one unifying factor or mode of approach that one can point to well
47:24
aristotle tells us that in every area the philosopher's got to begin by setting down what he calls the
47:29
appearances then working through the puzzles that these present us with and then coming back to them saving as he
47:36
puts it the greatest number and the most basic to show you what this is let me give you an example suppose you're a
47:41
philosopher working on the problem of time now what you'll do according to aristotle is begin by setting down not
47:48
only our perceptual experience concerning temporal succession and duration but also our ordinary beliefs and what
47:55
we say concerning time you'll set all this down then you'll see whether it presents you with any contradictions and
48:01
if you find contradictions there then you'll go to work sifting and sorting out and you'll try to see which of our beliefs are actually more basic than
48:08
others and you'll preserve those and then get rid of the ones that actually conflict with those so that you come
48:13
back in the end to ordinary discourse with increased structure and understanding but time or anything else
48:19
isn't the same thing as our belief about time or anything else does he make a clear distinction between the world and
48:26
our discourse about the world well here his notion of appearances covers both
48:32
our perceptual experience of the world and our ordinary sayings and beliefs now it's a broad conception and one that
48:38
admits of lots of further subdivisions and certainly he's perfectly prepared to say that sometimes we will rely more on
48:44
the experience of our senses and sometimes more on ordinary beliefs and sayings but i think he's right to think
48:50
that there's a general unifying notion here because after all our perception is interpretive and selective and it's a
48:58
part and parcel of our conceptual schemes and the ways that as human beings we make sense of the world isn't
49:03
there a danger though that this approach might be flat-footed or pedestrian because i mean if he always starts from
49:09
our experience our perceptions and takes off from that and always so to speak
49:15
returns to it at the end doesn't that mean that the whole of his philosophy is confined to the surface of the world of
49:22
experience when what we feel we actually want is more like what plato gives us something that gets
49:28
behind the surfaces or below the surfaces to a deeper more underlying level compared with which the surface is
49:35
indeed superficial yes i think you're right to bring in plato here and it's certainly true that for plato and lots
49:41
of the tradition that preceded plato the dominant image of philosophy is one of going behind or getting out there
49:48
walking to the rim of the universe and staring beyond at some transcendent reality that's above and beyond our experience but
49:55
actually i think aristotle would have two things to say about that first of all he would say that our experience is
50:00
an object of tremendous wonder richness beauty in its own right and then second
50:06
he will say that actually we never can coherently go beyond our experience that the only
50:12
project that we can really undertake is the mapping the investigating of the area of our experience now let me give
50:18
you an example of how he argues this point and here there's a fundamental principle in aristotle's thought which
50:24
he calls the principle of non-contradiction this is the principle that contradictory properties can't
50:29
apply to the same subject at the same time in the same respect for example my dress cannot be both blue and not blue
50:35
at the same time in the same place in the same respect and so forth now aristotle says this is a very basic
50:41
principle it's so basic that we seem to use it whenever we think and speak now how do we go about justifying such a
50:48
fundamental principle which is actually the most basic of all as he puts it well he tells us that we can't actually
50:54
justify it from without from outside our experience because in fact we use it in
50:59
all our experience in sorting out experience but suppose that an opponent challenges it now now aristotle says at
51:06
this point you ask the opponent whether the opponent is prepared to say anything anything definite at all now suppose he
51:12
doesn't say anything well then aristotle says you can dismiss that person because a person who doesn't say anything
51:17
insofar as he doesn't say anything is pretty well like a vegetable well now suppose on the other hand the
51:23
opponent does say something and it's something definite then says aristotle you can actually show that person that
51:29
in saying anything definite at all he or she is in fact making use of that very
51:34
principle that the person is challenging because in asserting something definite you've got to be at the same time ruling
51:41
something out at the very least the contradictory of what you've been asserting in the first place it's easy to see how fundamental logical
51:47
principles like this can be and indeed are inherent in all our discourse but not how they could provide a foundation
51:55
for the kind of knowledge it is that aristotle is seeking well i think aristotle here is eager to say that we cannot provide for any
52:03
principle a foundation that does stand altogether outside our discourse and our conceptual schemes and he gives a
52:09
further reason for this when he gives his general account of discourse his general account says that we can
52:14
designate in speech a thing only when it is actually impinged on the experience of one of us somebody in our linguistic
52:21
community for example he says we can signal thunder in discourse only when
52:26
somebody hears a noise in the clouds and at that point we're able to use the name thunder to refer to that
52:31
noise and then at that point we can start asking what is that thing there what explains it and we can go on to inquire more about what it is
52:38
but now suppose we tried to stand all together outside of experience and find some entity or entities that actually
52:44
had never entered the experience of any human being at all let's take for example plato's forms now aristotle says
52:50
look here plato tries to hang philosophy on forms like the form of the white which actually is imagined to be not the
52:57
color of any real body at all but just a white itself out there now that he says
53:04
is actually meaningless nonsense talk he says plato's forms in that sense are like meaningless syllables you say to
53:10
yourself when you're singing to yourself because we can't actually talk about things that haven't entered our
53:15
experience at all but if inquiry is confined solely to the world of experience why doesn't all of
53:22
it come under the rubric of what we now call science i mean what is specifically philosophical about it
53:28
well of course science and philosophy are not very sharply distinguished by aristotle but i think what he would say is that there is a general search for a
53:36
structure of explanation that's common to all the scientific areas and in his work the posterior analytics he provides
53:42
an account of how the philosopher will search for what he calls episteme or scientific understanding in every area
53:48
whatever and in every area the philosopher is supposed to find certain principles that are prior that are known
53:55
first and more basic than the others from which as conclusions of a deductive argument the conclusions of that science
54:02
will follow now here he says we have a faculty by which we're equipped to have insight
54:07
into the fundamental first principles and i want to pause here for a minute because i think this is also something that's been badly misunderstood about
54:14
aristotle this is a faculty which is called intellect or noose a rather
54:19
famous term in his thought and just being the greek word noose being the greek word for intellect or mind and
54:25
aristotle says that it's with this faculty of mind that we grasp first principles now for centuries
54:32
this was thought to be a special faculty of intellectual intuition by which we could step outside the sphere of our
54:37
experience and apprehend as it were prior to all experience the first principles of science now i think you
54:43
can see already why i want to say aristotle would be opposed to that kind of foundation for science but in fact
54:49
recent people who've been working on the text of the posterior analytics have argued quite successfully that that's
54:54
also a bad reading of the text that in reality what noose is is a kind of insight we get into the
55:01
explanatory role the fundamental status of a principle by our experience in using it to give scientific explanations
55:08
aristotle was wasn't he the first major western thinker to actually try and map out the separate sciences in fact he
55:15
gave some of them the names that we use to this day yes i think that's true and i think his
55:20
work has still been of importance for people working in those sciences particularly in the science of biology
55:26
and um and where his work on explanation has recently come to be extremely important and interesting now can you
55:32
give an example of the way he would go about as it were isolating a subject area as a single field of inquiry all
55:40
right well i'm going to give an example that's um in our view wouldn't be from one of the sciences as we think of it but a very
55:47
general inquiry that he has in his work on metaphysics into what he calls substance now this is i must interrupt
55:54
you higgs i think this word metaphysics which we're going to hear a lot of ought to be explained can you explain the word
56:00
well its origin is uh disappointingly trivial that is in an ancient edition of aristotle's work the editor put the work
56:07
that had the title uh metaphysics after the work that was called physics
56:13
or natural and the work the title simply means what comes after the work called physics it
56:20
means the book after the book after the book on physics and what does the word itself come to mean in philosophy
56:26
well it's hard to give a single account of this but roughly one might say i think that what metaphysics does is not
56:32
to isolate one range of things and inquire into those but to pursue some perfectly general questions that might
56:38
be asked about anything whatever questions about identity continuity logical form and so forth
56:44
the fundamental constituents of the world that we experience yeah space time matter etc the questions that pertain to
56:51
any object whatever that exists yeah now central in this whole project is the
56:58
question which aristotle calls the question about substance now i want to start by trying to ask what this
57:04
question means because i think we don't very naturally have an intuitive sense about what a question about substance
57:10
could possibly be now if we read what aristotle writes and try to reconstruct
57:15
what his questions are i think we find that there are really two questions which he holds together quite closely the first is a question about change and
57:23
the second is a question about identity now the question about change is this of course in our experience we come in
57:29
contact all the time with things that are changing that a the leaf buds
57:35
turns green turns yellow then withers a child is born grows mature withers
57:41
dies now the question is if we're to talk about these changing things there still must be some it that remains
57:48
the same while the attributes of the thing are changing or it will be very difficult for us to talk about it so the
57:54
question that aristotle asks here is what are the more continuous more persisting things on which we can anchor
58:00
our discourse about change things which themselves persist while properties or attributes are changing now the second
58:07
question which he calls the what is it question i call the question about identity
58:13
goes like this supposing i point at some object in my experience say brian mcgee and i say all right what is this really
58:19
now what i'm asking here is which of the many properties that you have which impress
58:25
themselves on my senses are the more fundamental ones the ones that you couldn't cease to have without ceasing
58:31
to be yourself you know now clearly you could change your jacket put on a different color of clothing and you
58:37
would still be brian mcgee on the other hand it's not so clear that you could cease to be human or cease to be made of
58:42
flesh and blood without ceasing to be yourself without in fact being dead so aristotle's question about identity is
58:49
the search for which are the parts or elements in the thing which do play that very fundamental role and they have to
58:56
play two roles isn't that right i mean which are the characteristics that are absolutely inherently fundamental
59:02
fundamental to any object to make it be that object and secondly what are the
59:08
characteristics that persist through any change so that the identity of the changing object remains the same
59:14
yes well aristotle wants to hold these questions tightly together and i think there's a good reason for that because
59:20
as he sees it to single out what it is that underlies change that persists through change you have to
59:25
single out something with a definite identity something about which you could answer the what is it question something that is uh structured enough definite
59:32
enough to be the subject of some discourse about change on the other hand if we're going to talk about the what is
59:38
it question we better have as our answer something that itself is persistent enough it's not always going out of
59:45
existence while we're actually talking about what it is now early philosophers before aristotle had not always held
59:50
these questions so closely together or they had focused on one uh and given strange answers as a result to the other
59:58
let me give you two examples some early natural philosophers were led seeing that it looked to them like
1:00:04
matter was the most persistent stuff i mean they could see that trees
1:00:10
children animals were born out of material stuff and then when they died what was left around was again material
1:00:17
stuff they concluded that matter was the basic underlying
1:00:22
principle of change and then they seemed to conclude from that that matter was also what things really are in some
1:00:28
fundamental way so they took an answer to the first question and without much further reflection they applied it
1:00:34
plugged it into the second one now on the other side is an explanation given by some platonous
1:00:40
theories i won't say by plato himself but one that aristotle finds in plato's school
1:00:45
which focuses on the identity question and tries to explain the identities of
1:00:50
things in terms of their relation to certain stable immaterial objects the forms in
1:00:57
something like this way they'll say well you brian mcgee are brown in color
1:01:02
because of your relation to the form of the brown you are human because of some relation in which you stand to the form
1:01:08
of the human and so forth now it's aristotle's view that
1:01:13
we've got to start in answering this second person i'm going to talk about the second person first and then come back to the
1:01:19
materialists we've got to start by distinguishing those two kinds of properties that you have because the
1:01:25
property of having brown color on you is a property that precisely is on or as
1:01:32
it were residing in you that is it's one you could easily lose without ceasing to be yourself whereas
1:01:38
as he would say the property of being human is not like that it's not one that you could lose without ceasing to be
1:01:44
yourself so in his early work the categories he distinguishes these two sorts of properties the ones that are
1:01:49
simply in the subject and the ones that as he puts it reveal the being the what
1:01:54
is it of the subject i think it's worth me interrupting at this point to make it clear to the
1:02:00
people listening to this discussion that as an approach which is adopted to absolutely everything which aristotle
1:02:08
did this makes it possible for us to describe as it were the whole of reality or the whole of any given reality that
1:02:15
is to say that you you first of all you pick out something anything
1:02:20
it can be a dog a table a person any material object anything you like you identify something
1:02:27
and then you say something about it you either attribute characteristics to it or you describe it as doing something or
1:02:33
describe it as having something done to it so these this double-barreled approach that you identify a subject and
1:02:41
then you predicate something of it this subject predicate approach
1:02:46
has been believed by thinkers ever since to be an approach that makes possible
1:02:52
the description of everything the description of a whole world in fact it's become built into our language and
1:02:58
our logic hasn't it yes but i think here what aristotle wants to insist on is that not all
1:03:03
predicates are on the same level that there are some which simply are predicated of a subject that we've
1:03:09
already picked out and identified but there are these other ones like human being or dog or tree which are
1:03:15
fundamental in identifying the subject in the first place we cannot pick out a bare subject and then tag predicates
1:03:21
onto it but the subject itself has to be identified under some description and its natural kind terms that play the
1:03:27
fundamental role here but of course we still haven't answered the materialists and we still haven't said
1:03:33
in the notion of human being what is the fundamental analysis of human being that will give
1:03:39
us the what is it of the subject so now this is what aristotle later goes on to do and this what is it question again applies to everything doesn't it i mean
1:03:46
it's aristotle's attempt to actually discover the true nature of the identity
1:03:51
of things of whatever exists including us yes it is i think living substances and
1:03:57
to some extent also artifacts play a very central role here and what he wants to now ask is all right we've now gotten
1:04:05
to the point where we see that notions that we call natural kinds notions like human being dog or statue say play a
1:04:12
fundamental role in identifying subjects in the world now we have to ask more precisely what
1:04:17
they are are they is what it is is it to be a human being is it to be a certain sort of material or is it to be a
1:04:24
certain structure and in the metaphysics he argues that what a substance is is
1:04:30
fundamentally not some material stuffs or constituents but it fundamentally is
1:04:35
a certain sort of order or structure which he calls a form now by that he doesn't mean simply shape or
1:04:41
configuration but he means in the case of say brian mcgee the way you're organized to function your form is an
1:04:48
organized set of functional capabilities that you've got to have so long as you're in existence now he gives us
1:04:55
three reasons for thinking that your materials couldn't be what it is to be you now first of all in the case of you
1:05:03
and other living things matter is always going in and out it's always changing and of course you do change your
1:05:08
material constituents very very often without ceasing to be yourself but second
1:05:14
even if that's not the case say with an artifact we our conception of an artifact is that so long as its
1:05:20
functional structure remains the same we could always replace bits of the matter without having a different thing on our
1:05:26
hands we could take a ship and replace some of its planks so long as it remained
1:05:31
that functional structure serving the function of a ship we would still have the same entity on
1:05:36
our hands finally he argues that matter is just not definite enough to be what a thing
1:05:42
really is matter is just a lump or heap of stuff and so we couldn't say you are
1:05:48
some stuff or other but it's only when we've identified the structure that the stuff constitutes that we can even go on
1:05:55
to say something intelligent about the stuff itself let me just go over those again because i think they have fun
1:06:00
arguments of a very fundamental kind he says first of all socrates i think the actual example he takes is socrates
1:06:06
isn't it socrates cannot consist of of the matter that goes to make up his body
1:06:12
because this matter is constantly changing and in fact changes completely several times in the course of socrates
1:06:18
is life but he's still the same socrates throughout that life so he can't just be the matter of which he consists
1:06:24
but secondly this applies to species as a whole a dog can't just be a dog in
1:06:30
virtue of the matter of which it consists because different different dogs are different i mean some some are brown
1:06:36
some are black some are white they're different colors different shapes different sizes different weights but they're all dogs so they can't be dogs
1:06:42
in virtue of the matter of which they consist and thirdly
1:06:47
just a heap of matter without any abstract qualities such as organization
1:06:53
or structure or form isn't a dog or a person or a shoe or a house or anything it is just a heap and
1:07:01
that anything can only be anything at all by virtue of its structure its form its function is that right yeah that
1:07:07
well you you your second one adds a further argument actually that i didn't mention uh yes the different species
1:07:13
members are all of course differently constituted materially that would be one further reason for rejecting the idea
1:07:19
that matter gives us a perfectly general account of what it is to be a member of that species but then i want to add the
1:07:24
further point that even when the matter in fact doesn't vary still our conception of what it is to be a certain
1:07:31
sort of thing say a ship doesn't identify it with the matter and we can see that by performing a thought
1:07:37
experiment that says if you replace the material bits just so long as you have continuity of functional structure then
1:07:43
you still have the same thing on your hands but now isn't this bringing aristotle dangerously close to plato's
1:07:50
theory of forms which he's rejected because isn't he now saying a dog isn't a dog by virtue of the matter of which
1:07:57
it consists it's a dog by virtue of its dogness it's it's abstract dogness isn't
1:08:03
he in that position or dangerously close to it well of course here we get to a very difficult area about what exactly
1:08:09
form is and i think no two philosophers are going to be in precise agreement about the interpretation on this but let
1:08:14
me try to say what i think now i think first of all it's quite clear that unlike plato he makes the form something
1:08:20
imminent to the particular it does not exist apart from that particular perceptible dog in some heavenly realm
1:08:27
of dogness but it's just there it's what the dog in fact is it's not separate
1:08:33
it's not an otherworldly right spirit right it's it's right there it's what
1:08:39
the dog really is it is that dog now the second thing i believe that
1:08:45
aristotelian forms are individuals that is their particulars and not universals
1:08:50
that is to say even though the definition of the doggy form of each dog
1:08:56
if i take five dogs i'm going to get only one definition of what it is to be a dog for all of them still if i ask how
1:09:03
many examples of doggy form do i have here well the answer is the number is five i mean just as many dogs as there
1:09:10
are each one although quite like in quality will be exactly one in number as
1:09:16
he puts it that'd be uh we count forms by counting the number of substances that we have on our hands
1:09:23
i must say it seems to me even sort of getting on for three thousand years later that these arguments against materialism are devastating do you think
1:09:31
that aristotle has effectively ever ever been answered by materialist philosophers
1:09:37
no i don't think he has and i think what i find so powerful about these arguments is that he starts arguing against
1:09:43
materialism not only within the context of philosophy of mind and not only by picking out some special characteristics
1:09:50
of the mental which make it different from everything else but precisely here by developing these general theories of
1:09:56
identity and substance which show why for things quite generally including
1:10:01
artifacts material reductionism is not a good way to go now can you give us an example of an actual area in which
1:10:08
aristotle puts this approach to work and starts identifying in some specific
1:10:13
field what sorts of things there are well now we can turn i think to an area
1:10:19
that's really very close to his general metaphysics since his general metaphysics is already concerned quite
1:10:24
closely as we see with things like human beings dogs and other natural entities
1:10:30
to the area of philosophy of nature now here aristotle is interested in trying to say what kinds of explanations the
1:10:37
philosopher of nature can give across the board how many kinds of explanations the philosopher is going to find useful
1:10:43
he tells us that philosophy in fact begins with a sense of wonder before the world of nature that when we see the
1:10:50
world we're struck by awe and wonder because we see these wonderful things going on and we can't understand why
1:10:56
they work as they do he says it's rather like seeing a puppet show where you see these mechanisms moving and you know
1:11:02
that behind there there must be some hidden mechanism that explains why it moves as it does but you don't know yet
1:11:07
what it is and you want to search and find out now the question is what kind of explanation are you searching for when
1:11:13
you ask this why question why does it work as it does now here aristotle thinks that lots of philosophers have
1:11:19
been too simple because they fail to notice how many different ways we ask and answer these why questions and he
1:11:25
wants to say that there's not just one kind of explanation that's useful here but in fact an open-ended list but at
1:11:32
any rate at least four types seem to him to be quite important now these are of course the famous four causes we hear
1:11:39
about aristotle's four causes i think it's important to say that those are really four kinds of explanations there
1:11:46
are four big causes four b causes yes that's good um four kinds of answers two why questions
1:11:52
and of course they're called the material cause and here the material
1:11:57
form of explanation says say we take the question why does a tree grow as it does well the material
1:12:03
question material explanation will say the tree grows as it does because it's made of such and such materials
1:12:10
now that form of explanation is very useful and interesting but we can already guess that aristotle is going to
1:12:16
think it can't do the work alone without this other kind of explanation which he calls the formal explanation
1:12:22
that says the tree grows as it does because it's structured in such and such a way that is its form
1:12:29
so you see here the link with the metaphysical arguments then there's a third kind called the
1:12:34
efficient cause or efficient explanation which says the tree grows as it does because various things from the
1:12:41
environment push it in certain ways perhaps the incoming materials or the earth and so on push it from behind in
1:12:47
such and such ways then the last one which i think has been the most misunderstood one is the one
1:12:53
that he calls the final cause and which we often call the teleological form of explanation because it refers to an end
1:13:01
or telos towards which the thing moves now this says the tree grows as it does
1:13:07
for the sake of becoming a certain sort of mature tree in other words things in
1:13:13
nature are always moving towards the flourishing of their adult condition
1:13:20
now that there's a mystical or magical element in that that doesn't appear in any of the others or there seems to be
1:13:26
well see that i think i want to say that's a misunderstanding too um first of all aristotle's not saying that
1:13:33
there's anything magical out there in the future that goes down and pulls the
1:13:38
tree towards its future form as it were from the future exerting a causal pull
1:13:44
from the future no it's all quite natural it's happening within the tree itself
1:13:49
it's a way of talking about the plastic and resourceful behavior of living things it's a way of offering a unified
1:13:55
account of the way that things like trees in a variety of different natural circumstances always move in the way
1:14:01
that promotes their continued life and their development towards their mature form so you see it's saying that in a
1:14:08
variety of different climates and weathers the tree will always move towards the sun and its roots will go
1:14:14
towards water and the source of nourishment and that's a perfectly general explanation which will give us a way of understanding
1:14:21
the variety of the different things that the tree does so you see in that there's nothing
1:14:26
supernatural there also isn't anything that refers to powers of mind or desire inside the tree
1:14:34
itself it's just a way of talking about the resourcefulness of natural movement
1:14:39
now a lot of scholars have accredited to aristotle the notion that there are souls in everything do you
1:14:46
think they've understood him correctly and is that part of his teleological explanation no i think they have
1:14:51
misunderstood the way he uses teleological explanations
1:14:56
i think he uses them only for living beings in the first place i don't think he uses teleological explanations at all
1:15:02
for things like eclipses thunderstorms and so on in fact he says that eclipse is not for the sake of anything but in
1:15:09
the case of living beings it's not a matter of mind or
1:15:14
soul in our sense where that seems to imply some power of mind it's a matter of the general character of what has
1:15:20
life now now we get to his work on life now this word
1:15:26
life uh is often translated by our word soul and he wrote a work that was called
1:15:32
on su k which really means on life or the principle of life and it's usually
1:15:38
translated in english as on the soul now in reality i think our word soul contains so many con connotations of
1:15:45
spirituality and mentality that it's misleading to use that word here and we'd better think of this as a general
1:15:52
inquiry into life in the living what aristotle tries to do in this work is ask and answer the question
1:15:58
what is the animating principle in living things of many different kinds including plants animals human beings
1:16:05
can we give some general account of what it is to be alive and the answer he gives is that the
1:16:11
animating principle is the form of a living body that's potentially
1:16:17
organized so as to function exercise the functions of life
1:16:22
now by form of course he means not mere shape or configuration but as we've
1:16:27
already seen he means a kind of functional structure or organization so what it would be for you brian mcgee to
1:16:33
be alive would be to be organized so that you can nourish yourself so that you can perceive think exercise all the
1:16:40
functions that are characteristic of your type of life and what aristotle's saying is that this is an organization
1:16:46
of matter i mean it's got to be realized at every point in some matter
1:16:52
but it's that organization that's your life it's not the matter that makes it up so
1:16:57
that when it's when you lose those functional structures that you would be dead and he applied the same principle
1:17:03
to non-living things isn't he i remember there's one point in his writings where he says that if an axe had a soul then
1:17:09
that soul would be cutting in other words what he's saying is that somehow the essence of an axe for
1:17:16
example is what it does is its function isn't that right yeah now he uses that
1:17:22
of course counter factually he says if if it had and the way he uses it is to illustrate this point that by form he
1:17:29
doesn't just mean the acts like shape and he doesn't mean the fact that it's made of such and such metal but he means
1:17:35
the power to exercise certain functions so this is a way of giving us some insight into the more mysterious case of
1:17:42
the living creature that what it would be for that creature to have a certain animating principle is of course not not
1:17:49
for you brian mcgee to have exactly a certain shape because of course you could change your shape
1:17:54
without being dead i've done it frequently and uh but what it is of course is to have that
1:18:00
power to function in various ways and it's losing that that you would be dead yeah now we've covered a lot of ground
1:18:06
and even so it touches on only a tiny fraction of aristotle's output that's inevitable in the short time that we
1:18:13
have but can you take three paces back from what we've been talking about and
1:18:18
draw some implications from it to modern philosophy what contemporary concerns in
1:18:25
philosophy are being directly influenced by aristotle's work well i think one is the
1:18:30
one we've just been discussing in fact the philosophy of of life and here
1:18:36
we call this area the philosophy of mind cordoning off in a way that aristotle wouldn't do the mental powers of
1:18:42
perception and thought from the rest of the functions of life but i think in his general work on life he has some very
1:18:49
important conclusions for contemporary philosophy of mind he tries to show us how material reductionism that says that
1:18:57
perception is simply a material process of a certain sort is inadequate to explain
1:19:04
the functional characteristics of life and on the other hand in order to reject
1:19:09
material reductionism we don't have to introduce some mysterious immaterial entities but what
1:19:15
we want to say is that perception is a process that cannot be reduced to a
1:19:21
material process because it's realized in always different matter and because the notion of intentionality
1:19:28
and outward focusing is fundamental to the correct characterization of the sort of awareness perception is
1:19:34
but on the other hand it's not anything mysterious or separate from matter either but it is a function that's
1:19:40
always as it would as he puts it constituted in matter realized in some
1:19:46
matter or other that seems to me to be an idea of fundamental importance which still isn't universally understood that
1:19:52
we are not confronted with the choice between being either materialists on the one hand and believing in some as it
1:19:59
were spiritual or abstract realm on the other there is a third way of explanation of our experience and it is
1:20:06
as you're suggesting a way that aristotle pioneered yes now there's something we haven't touched
1:20:13
on in this discussion at all but i think we must say something about it and that is aristotle's writing on ethics i don't
1:20:20
think it would be any exaggeration to say that he's the most influential moral philosopher that there's ever been
1:20:27
now can you tell us something about where his gigantic influence in this field springs
1:20:33
from i think his influence to me springs first of all from the question that he begins with
1:20:39
some many moral philosophers begin by making a sharp distinction between the
1:20:44
sphere of the moral and all the rest of human life and they begin ethics with the question what is my duty or what is
1:20:51
my moral duty now aristotle begins instead with a much more general question that is what is it to lead a
1:20:57
good human life and this allows him to investigate the areas that we would
1:21:03
associate with the moral alongside and in their relation to other
1:21:08
areas of human life such as intellectual commitment personal love and friendship
1:21:13
and to ask subtle questions about their interrelationships and what it would be to construct a good life out of all these elements so he has a very rich
1:21:20
sense of what morality consists in that's a contrast with some other very
1:21:26
famous moral philosophers isn't it for example the utilitarians thought that the single measure of all moral behavior
1:21:33
was happiness happiness or pain and that you could you could chart the the desirability or non-desirability of all
1:21:40
moral action on one single measuring rod which was named happiness now aristotle
1:21:46
was very alive to the fact that you couldn't do that wasn't he yes you mentioned the image of the
1:21:52
measuring rod that's very important one for aristotle now in fact it's not only that he refuses to reduce the many
1:21:59
things of value to one single measure but he also wants to say that even in each area you can't approach a complex
1:22:07
context with a straight edge so to speak he gives this image and he says that just as an architect is not going to try
1:22:13
to measure a complex fluted column with a straight ruler so too the ethical judge is not going to take a simple and
1:22:21
inflexible set of rules into the complexities of a practical situation instead just as the architect measures
1:22:27
with a flexible strip of metal which as he puts it bends to the shape of the stone and is not fixed even so you or i
1:22:34
coming into a complex ethical situation have to have our faculties as it were open and responsive ready to
1:22:42
shape ourselves to the complex perhaps non-repeatable demands of this particular situation and as he says the
1:22:49
discrimination rests with perception which is going to be prior to any rules at all
1:22:54
and another thing that impresses me very much about aristotle's moral philosophy is his firm grasp of the fact that we
1:23:01
don't as it were control our own moral environment that we can't be as the later stoics
1:23:08
wanted us to be entirely self-contained moral entities and we can't be as
1:23:13
perhaps the epicureans later wanted we can't be detached moral entities we live
1:23:19
in a moral environment which buffets us about and that we can't entirely master
1:23:24
he seems to have understood that yes i think he's understood it better than almost any philosopher who's written in
1:23:29
this area that the good life for a human being if it's to be rich enough to include everything that's of value say
1:23:36
for example personal love and friendship has got to be vulnerable to many factors
1:23:41
that we don't altogether control and that any attempt to close off those areas of vulnerability is going to
1:23:47
result in an impoverishment of our life and do you think he had anything like the notion of model luck which
1:23:53
philosophers have written about in recent years yes i think he does that is he uh certainly does ask the question
1:24:00
which features of the good life are not under our control and how can our not only our ability to act virtuously but
1:24:07
actually our virtuous character itself be shaped and altered by factors that we don't control
1:24:12
now i think myself he doesn't go quite far enough here because he's so interested in describing
1:24:18
a good life that's harmonious and balanced that is his image is always of a life where there are many components
1:24:24
that's very rich in different sorts of value but where everything is engineered and balanced together in harmony and i
1:24:31
think this prevents him from doing justice to the way that certain constituents of a life
1:24:37
if properly pursued in all their depth actually can have it in them to
1:24:42
challenge and call into question all the others that uh say take the way that
1:24:47
deep love can sometimes threaten and oppose virtue i think this is something that aristotle
1:24:53
is very silent on it's an area of moral luck which i would regard as very important that he
1:24:58
actually says nothing about in fact he has almost nothing at all to say about erotic love
1:25:04
i think because he's so interested in having something that's harmonious and balanced now up to this point in our
1:25:10
discussion we've been so concerned to get across some of the really important ideas that he put forward that we
1:25:15
haven't stopped to critically evaluate them but you've now put your finger on one aspect of his
1:25:21
thought which is in your view a shortcoming what are one or two of the other major
1:25:27
respects in which you think aristotle's opened the criticism well i think one of the major areas is
1:25:33
his political theory now i think there are a lot of good things here and among the good things is an account of
1:25:40
politics or the role of government as providing all the necessary conditions to each citizen
1:25:46
for the living of a rich and good human life an account of the good as based on a variety of different functionings
1:25:53
that actually go to constitute a good human life but the problem comes with his account of who it is who's to be a
1:25:59
citizen and here he has a a very narrow-minded attitude towards
1:26:05
the foreigner towards women but isn't it being unfairly anachronistic
1:26:10
to condemn aristotle from our position now in the 20th century for having been
1:26:15
for having undervalued women or undervalued the lower orders or undervalued foreigners because after all didn't more or less
1:26:22
everybody at that time think in that way no i don't think so
1:26:27
certainly on the issue of slavery he's opposed to some more radical positions that would say that all slavery is
1:26:32
unjust he knows those positions he argues against them and in the case of women
1:26:38
well i think first of all in just in his biology of women he rejects theories that are vastly more informed and more
1:26:44
correct than his about the contribution of women to reproduction you know he thinks that a woman doesn't actually
1:26:50
contribute any formal characteristics to the offspring well even democracy is just a sort of conduit
1:26:57
for the offspring and in politics of course plato was able to take a position of detachment towards women that did come
1:27:04
to the conclusion that we better educate each individual person in the state according to that person's
1:27:10
personal capabilities and uh that meant to plato that women ought to be given
1:27:15
the chance to be assessed as individuals and to be educated accordingly thank you very much martha nussbaum
1:27:21
thank you brian for purposes of teaching it's customary to divide history at least the history
Anthony Kenny on Medieval Philosophy
1:27:27
of the west into certain very broad periods such as ancient medieval and modern and we do exactly the same thing
1:27:34
with philosophy we talk of ancient philosophy medieval philosophy and modern philosophy and you'll find that
1:27:41
most histories of philosophy are divided into those three sections ancient philosophy is dominated by the
1:27:47
writings of two people plato and aristotle of course there were other important and interesting philosophers
1:27:54
in the ancient world not only before plato and aristotle but also after them but no one who has left writings of
1:28:00
comparable quantity caliber and influence if you went to a university to study
1:28:06
ancient philosophy you'd find yourself spending most of your time and perhaps even all of it on the work of those two
1:28:12
philosophers you'd then probably skip straight from aristotle to modern philosophy jumping
1:28:19
over the medieval period entirely medieval philosophy is for a long time been the cinderella of the subject's
1:28:25
history and we're talking now about a period of a thousand years or more from the fall of the roman empire to the
1:28:31
renaissance i think the chief reason for this is that throughout that period virtually
1:28:36
every important philosopher was an ecclesiastic whereas in the century or two leading up to our own time there's
1:28:42
been a widespread reaction against religion especially against its hold on thought
1:28:48
during that reaction medieval philosophers came under suspicion of not pursuing the truth wherever it might
1:28:54
lead but of trying to find good reasons for what they believed already like most reactions including healthy
1:29:01
ones this one went too far the greatest medieval philosophers were true giants
1:29:06
doing genuine philosophy as we understand it today and we can still learn a lot from them
1:29:13
as in the case of ancient philosophy among the medieval philosophers there are also two figures who stand out from
1:29:19
the rest though in this case they're at almost opposite ends of the period from each other
1:29:24
saint augustine was born in north africa in the year 354 a.d and died there in
1:29:30
430 two of his books are still universally acknowledged as being among the world's
1:29:36
great literature the confessions and the city of god the other figure of comparable stature
1:29:43
is thomas aquinas who was born in italy in the year 1225 and died there in 1274.
1:29:50
he was a much more technical sort of philosopher than augustine his most famous works are two enormous compendia
1:29:57
one called summa contra gentiles which has been translated into english under
1:30:02
the title on the truth of the catholic faith and the other summer theologiae or
1:30:09
summary of theology the death of saint augustine and the fall of the roman empire were followed
1:30:15
by the period we call the dark ages during those centuries it was as much as the literate and learned in western
1:30:22
europe could do to cling to the remnants of civilization they saw their role as essentially
1:30:28
preservative and for a long time scarcely any new intellectual work of lasting importance was done
1:30:35
during the 700 years from augustine to anselm there was only one philosopher of
1:30:40
the front rank john the scott who lived in the 9th century but once we get to anselm in the 11th
1:30:46
century we embark on a steady flow of significant thinkers just a few of the names are abellard in the 12th century
1:30:54
roger bacon and thomas aquinas in the 13th then dun scotus followed by william
1:30:59
of ockham and then the medieval period itself is beginning to come to an end
1:31:05
to tell us a little about this long but unfamiliar and fascinating period in philosophy's history i've invited the
1:31:11
master of bail college oxford anthony kenny one of the few contemporary philosophers to have written extensively
1:31:18
about medieval philosophy and himself a former roman catholic priest anthony
1:31:23
kenny before we start talking about specific issues or the work of individual philosophers is there
1:31:28
anything you'd like to add to that very brief sketch map of the period that i put forward just now
1:31:34
i'd agree with the your choice of two philosophers to sum up the achievement of the middle
1:31:40
ages augustine and aquinas but they're both very different people
1:31:47
augustine is a solitary thinker somebody who's best known work as you
1:31:53
said is an autobiography his confessions a book
1:31:58
drawing enormously on his own meditation his own reading of the bible his own interior life
1:32:06
aquinas is very different he lives as you said at a much later period and aquinas is not
1:32:13
a solitary figure he is somebody right in the middle of a religious and academic tradition
1:32:20
he's one of the great order of dominican friars he lived his life within communities of friars he's also a
1:32:27
university teacher one of his great achievements was the
1:32:33
production of these two magnificent university textbooks that's what his great works are they're essentially
1:32:38
university textbooks an enormous contrast with augustine who was such a lonely figure that at the end of his
1:32:44
life when he was a bishop he was the only man in the whole town who had any books at all
1:32:49
these these are in fact two perennial types of the philosopher aren't they the lonely isolated introspective thinker
1:32:56
and the institution man the university teacher yes as you go on in the history of
1:33:02
philosophy you find people falling into these two types in the pattern of augustine you have the
1:33:09
solitary geniuses like descartes and spinoza spinning their thought out of their own
1:33:15
heads as it were you also have the learned university professors like kant
1:33:21
and hegel developing systems which were then to be handed on and modified to pupils and
1:33:26
later generations of philosophers now it's during the period that we're discussing the middle ages that universities were invented and this very
1:33:34
fact had a simply enormous influence on philosophy didn't it and the way it was taught the way it was studied can you
1:33:40
say a little bit about that yes i think that is one of the most important contributions of the middle
1:33:45
ages to philosophy is that it founded the university by university meaning a corporation of
1:33:52
people engaged professionally full-time on the teaching of a corpus of knowledge
1:34:00
handing it on to their pupils having an agreed syllabus having agreed
1:34:06
methods of teaching and having very high professional standards it's very remarkable thing how
1:34:13
professional philosophy was in the middle ages first of all there's just the enormous output of the philosophers
1:34:20
aquinas wrote at about the lowest estimate 8 million words there are a number of other disputed works which
1:34:26
might bring it up to 11 million now 8 million words is a lot to write the whole of the surviving works of
1:34:32
aristotle are only a million works words the whole of the surviving works of plato are only half a million
1:34:39
aquinas in quite a short lifetime writes eight million words and they're not words just tossed off they're words that
1:34:46
scholars to this day can argue about the meaning of so the output is enormous the rigor is
1:34:52
very great aquinas's works bear the stamp of the medieval technique of disputation it was
1:35:00
one of the great medieval methods of teaching the teacher would put up two of his
1:35:05
pupils a senior and junior one the senior pupil would have to defend
1:35:11
some particular thesis for instance that the world was not created in time
1:35:17
or for that matter the world was created in time the opposite thesis would have to be
1:35:22
presented and the main thesis attacked by one of the other pupils the two would argue it out with each other they had to
1:35:28
argue according to strict logical rules and then the teacher would settle the
1:35:33
dispute try to bring out what was true in what had been said by one what was wrong in the
1:35:39
criticisms made by the others and if you open saint thomas's summer theologia
1:35:44
though it's not itself a record of of live disputations it bears the stamp of
1:35:50
that whenever aquinas is going to present a particular doctrine or philosophical thesis or theological
1:35:56
thesis he begins by presenting three of the strongest arguments he can think of against the truth of that thesis a
1:36:02
marvelous intellectual discipline it prevents you from taking things for granted makes you think now who have i
1:36:08
got to convince of what and what are the strongest things they could say on the other side that's
1:36:14
those are two of the things the voluminous output the rigorous method of presentation then there's the syllabus
1:36:21
a university syllabus means that you have a lot of topics
1:36:26
which anybody going to university is expected to learn a corpus of knowledge that they're expected to master
1:36:33
state of the art which they have to reach and then they add their own little bit their own little stone to the
1:36:39
can of the scientific edifice and then hand it on to their pupils hopefully enhanced but it must be
1:36:45
preserved now in the middle ages the syllabus is set especially by the surviving works of aristotle
1:36:52
aristotle's works at the beginning of the high middle ages were translated into latin very few of the great
1:36:57
medieval philosophers could read greek but they had good translations of aristotle
1:37:03
and they worked a way to extract all the knowledge that it was possible to expect from aristotle and then
1:37:10
develop it now uh before we come to the content of this there's one other question i want
1:37:15
to put you about the period as a whole and it may sound at first blush rather a parochial question but it could possibly
1:37:22
have an interesting explanation by way of answer i think any british person coming to the
1:37:28
study of uh medieval philosophy is likely to be struck by how very many of the leading figures either came from the
1:37:36
british islands or spent a very significant part of their career here say something like archbishop of
1:37:41
canterbury i mean that's true of those i mentioned in my introduction it's true of john the scot saint anselm roger
1:37:47
bacon dun scotus william vockham is it sheer coincidence or is there
1:37:52
actually an interesting explanation for it i think it is a striking fact but i think that it's an optical illusion if
1:37:58
it suggests that there was something especially british about philosophy uh in the i wasn't suggesting in the middle
1:38:03
80s it's true that a lot of the philosophers spent some of their time in britain and
1:38:10
some of them were british by birth but after all anselm one of your figures was in fact
1:38:15
an italian and uh dun scotus and william of ockham spent quite a lot of their time on the
1:38:21
continent the reason why if you picked any country you would be able to say quite a number
1:38:26
of the great philosophers spent time here was because the european university community
1:38:32
in the middle ages was very much a european uh community the christendom the
1:38:39
nations of christianity were all a single academic community somebody
1:38:44
graduating in one university would go and teach in another university all the universities spoke common language the
1:38:51
latin of the church and there was a great deal of academic migration at least in the early middle
1:38:57
ages later on you get nationalistic wars like the hundred years war between
1:39:02
england and france that means that you get an interruption of travel you get the development of the
1:39:07
vernacular literatures which means that people even if they go on speaking latin are
1:39:13
beginning to think in english it's a significant fact i think that the the last of the really great medieval
1:39:18
philosophers um was john wickliffe just after william of ockham
1:39:24
and he was also of course is well known for the translation of the bible into
1:39:30
english whether he did it himself or whether he got a gang of his pupils to do it he was the inspiration of the
1:39:35
translation of the bible he stands at the end of the international latin academic community and at the beginning
1:39:42
of the gradual fission of the different national cultures in their own languages now one uh concern that was perennial
1:39:49
throughout the middle ages among philosophers and you just started to touch on this earlier was the desire to
1:39:55
reconcile the great classic philosophers of ancient greece plato in the earlier
1:40:00
middle ages predominantly perhaps aristotle in the later middle ages with the christian religion wasn't it
1:40:07
that was something they were preoccupied with from beginning to end can you say something about that
1:40:13
that was particularly so uh with regard to aquinas and those who succeeded him
1:40:20
augustine uh was much more interested i think in the philosophy of plato than he was of
1:40:27
aristotle and he was very much more interested in the the bible as a source of knowledge and information than he was
1:40:34
in any philosopher at all augustine's presence broods over the whole of the middle ages and he's
1:40:41
regarded by the later medieval philosophers as you might say the best codification
1:40:48
of all the religious knowledge that's to be found in the christian tradition through the bible in saint paul and then
1:40:54
through centre augustine but then when aristotle is translated into latin they begin to realize in the
1:41:00
12th and 13th centuries that there's another great corpus of information about the world about human
1:41:07
beings about why we're here about where we're going what we should do and that is the philosophy of the
1:41:13
ancients and especially of aristotle aristotle was a genius in so many
1:41:18
different ways he founded so many of the disciplines that later grew into
1:41:23
branches of philosophy and later grew into branches of science such as logic
1:41:29
metaphysics biology psychology botany meteorology all these and many
1:41:35
others are sciences which really began with aristotle and the most mature version of these sciences available to
1:41:41
the early middle ages was the presentation i was going to ask you a question which bears on that but the
1:41:47
question really is this why did they care because of their commitment to the
1:41:52
christian religion were they not of the view that christianity provided them
1:41:57
with all the knowledge of the nature of things that they already needed christianity provided them with enough
1:42:04
knowledge for for salvation that the the humble washerwoman who knew the truth of
1:42:10
the christian faith and was completely ignorance of the ignorant of the science of the ancients
1:42:16
uh she had just as much chance of getting to heaven and living in glory with god as somebody as learned as thomas aquinas
1:42:23
but it would be quite wrong to think of them of people like aquinas as having only their eye on religion they were
1:42:31
men of intellectual curiosity who wanted to know all they could
1:42:37
about human beings and about the world of course they were interested in human beings in the world as god's creatures
1:42:43
but they thought that god had not only things to tell the world through the sacred books like the bible but that we
1:42:50
could learn a great deal about god's plans by looking at god's own creation by looking at the world and
1:42:56
what the different sciences could tell us about them i think something that struck me very heavily when i came to
1:43:02
read medieval philosophy for the first time was how much of it didn't have to do with religion i mean how much really
1:43:10
solid work in logic there is how much linguistic analysis of a very modern seeming kind to us there is and then
1:43:17
work in things like um mechanics or psychology i mean the field is enormously wide isn't it oh it is
1:43:24
it's the the germ of many of the sciences which now have set up house on
1:43:29
their own after the renaissance set up as disciplines on their own they're all to be found as it were children growing
1:43:35
up in this great household of philosophy in the middle ages the titles of some of the professors at the ancient
1:43:41
universities echo this i mean there is a professor of physics in oxford whose title is
1:43:46
professor of natural philosophy because that was how the discipline of physics began as the study of natural philosophy
1:43:52
itself a meditation on the text of aristotle called the physics
1:43:59
the aristotelian works themselves traced out the syllabus for the middle
1:44:04
ages aristotle's work began with the logic which the science which he created and
1:44:10
which grew enormously in the middle ages one of the first things which anybody going to a medieval university would
1:44:16
learn was logic and we've rediscovered in recent years
1:44:23
many highly refined theorems and techniques of logic which were quite familiar to beginning undergraduates
1:44:30
towards the end of the middle ages logic at the renaissance and the reformation
1:44:35
was cut off short and only a small truncated torso of logic
1:44:41
was then taught in most european universities until the end of the 19th century then in the 19th century a new
1:44:47
generation of logicians mathematical logicians people like gottlob fraga in germany and bertrand russell and alfred
1:44:54
north whitehead in cambridge they coming to logic from a different viewpoint from a mathematical viewpoint
1:45:00
tracing mathematics back to its origins in logic they set on foot a great new rebirth of
1:45:06
logic one of its flowerings was principia mathematica the great work in which russell and whitehead tried to
1:45:13
show that the whole of arithmetic could be derived simply from pure logical truisms if you studied them
1:45:20
systematically enough this rebirth of logic in the present century led to the rediscovery in the
1:45:27
30s and later branches of logic which had been totally lost since the middle ages and it's only in my own generation
1:45:34
that people have begun to put the two together and realize that some of the most modern ideas of logic were things that were well known in the middle ages
1:45:40
would it be true to say that that philosophy uh as studied and taught in western europe was logic centered in the
1:45:48
middle ages is logic centered now but hasn't been for most of the period in
1:45:53
between would that be true i would agree with that and i think it's why one sometimes gets an extraordinary feeling
1:45:59
of uh sympathy and familiarity coming from a modern philosophical background
1:46:04
and reading late medieval i must say that that was true for me in a very strong way when i read writers like dun
1:46:11
scotus and william of ockham for the first time it was like reading the young bertrand russell you mentioned or fraga
1:46:16
i mean these were people obviously serving in the same shop so to speak
1:46:22
they were in business at the same stand i expected it to be something alien and distant and strange and quite to the
1:46:29
contrary it was something utterly familiar to me after the middle ages people lost interest in logic and to a
1:46:36
great extent lost interest in in language at least lost interest in the philosophical study of language they're
1:46:41
very very interested in the rhetorical and literary study of language but lost interest in the philosophical study of
1:46:47
language from descartes onwards philosophers put epistemology in the center of their discipline that is the
1:46:53
question how do we know what do we know how can we know what we know logic and language go to the background
1:46:59
since fraga and russell and in the present generation particularly in britain and america logic and language are in the forefront
1:47:06
of philosophy the philosoph philosopher's great question nowadays is not what do you know but what do you
1:47:12
mean and the question of the meaning of what we say the insistence that any other question whether it's in science
1:47:19
or mathematics or anything else must be accompanied with a very careful
1:47:24
awareness of what we mean by asking the question if whatever to get an answer that's something that was very typical
1:47:29
of the middle ages and is typical of philosophy again now but had disappeared
1:47:34
in the intervening period now i suppose the commonest charge made against medieval philosophy in general
1:47:41
and i mentioned this in my introduction to this discussion is the charge that because it was carried out by people who
1:47:47
were already committed before they started to the christian faith they weren't really as i put it earlier
1:47:53
pursuing the truth wherever it might lead they were looking for good reasons for what they already believed what
1:48:00
would your answer be to that accusation well first of all i'd say that it isn't necessarily um
1:48:06
a serious charge against a philosopher to say that he's looking for good reasons for what he already believes in
1:48:12
um descartes for instance sitting beside his fire wearing his dressing gown
1:48:18
was looking for good reasons for believing that and took a remarkable long time to find them
1:48:23
bertrand russell who accused aquinas of not being a real
1:48:29
philosopher because he was looking for reasons for what he already believed it's extraordinary that that
1:48:35
accusation should be made by russell who in that book principia mathematica which i mentioned
1:48:41
takes hundreds of pages to prove to you that two and two make four which is something he's believed all his life
1:48:47
but more seriously i think that well i mean it's worth interrupting at that point i think to to say quite explicitly
1:48:54
that provided it's acknowledged in a fully professional way that the goodness of the reasons is essential then in a
1:49:01
way it doesn't matter what you already believe provided arguments and reasons are subjected without limit to fully
1:49:08
rigorous tests yes i think that's right it doesn't matter what you believe as a philosopher
1:49:13
the the philosopher is the person whose task it is to tell good arguments from bad
1:49:19
and uh it doesn't in a way matter what the starting or ending point is for a
1:49:24
philosophy it may matter a lot for other reasons indeed the distinction that you and i have just made between what you believe
1:49:30
and the reasons for which you believe it is something that was very much brought out by thomas aquinas
1:49:36
perhaps more than by any other philosopher because he was committed to a lot of beliefs as
1:49:42
a christian there were a lot of other things which he believed because he read aristotle and he's very careful to make a
1:49:49
distinction between these things a distinction which we might say in modern terminology is making a
1:49:55
distinction between his job as a theologian and his job as a philosopher he sees his job as a
1:50:01
theologian above all to articulate make explicit and defend
1:50:07
the revelation of the history of the world and the future of the world and the salvation of the world contained in the
1:50:14
sacred books of christianity and in the teaching of the church as a philosopher
1:50:20
his job is to get as far as he can in discovering what
1:50:25
kind of place the world is in what truths we know necessary truths about
1:50:31
the world and about all of thought just using the unaided reason not appealing to any
1:50:37
alleged divine revelation he makes a very striking point with regard to one specific issue about that
1:50:43
which sticks in my mind he says at one point that if one considers the philosophical
1:50:48
arguments then there is no uh compelling reason why one shouldn't believe that
1:50:54
the world has always existed but as a christian he doesn't believe that he believe as a
1:50:59
christian he believes that the world had a beginning because god created it that's right that's a very good example
1:51:05
there there were a number of christian philosophers who thought that you could prove that the world must have had a
1:51:11
beginning essentially because they didn't believe in certain kinds of infinite series aquinas shows the flaws in their
1:51:17
arguments and says no there's nothing self-contradictory in the idea that the world went on
1:51:23
has gone on forever and will go on forever as indeed aristotle believed it had so
1:51:28
that aquinas thinks that with the unaided human reason you cannot prove that the word had a
1:51:35
beginning equally you can't prove that it didn't have a beginning and he objects to
1:51:40
aristotle who thought it could aquinas is much more agnostic as a philosopher he says you can't prove it either way
1:51:47
if you asked him well then why do you believe that the world did have a beginning he'd say well because it says
1:51:52
so in the first verse of the book of genesis in the bible but that's something i believe as a christian as a
1:51:57
theologian not as a philosopher you mentioned his two great works at the beginning the summer contra gentiles and
1:52:05
the summer theology summer contra gentiles is meant as a philosophical work that is it's
1:52:12
directed to people who are not christians who may be muslims who may be jews who may be
1:52:18
atheists and it aims to present them with purely
1:52:24
human reasons with reasons that any human being of goodwill can see to be good reasons for believing that there is
1:52:30
a god that the soul is immortal and so on the summer theologia is very different
1:52:35
it's addressed to christians it does accept as being good starting points for arguments that it says in the
1:52:42
bible such and such though there's an enormous amount of philosophical uh reflection contained in this work even
1:52:49
though its title describes it as a book of theology let's take now a particular issue about
1:52:55
which there was uh argument throughout the period the existence of god and whether or not this could be
1:53:02
demonstrated as you say uh it was clear to christian philosophers that if we were addressing
1:53:08
muslims or jews it was no good appealing to the authority of the church or the bible because muslims didn't accept that
1:53:15
authority so you were thrown back on argument and they seemed to me to have taken a very professional view of precisely
1:53:23
what what did and what did not constitute a good argument in this field now i suppose the most famous of all
1:53:30
arguments for the existence of god in the history of philosophy at any rate is the ontological argument it crops up
1:53:36
later in descartes in spinoza enlighten leibniz it's even of interest to a number of philosophers today
1:53:43
and its classic formulation was in the 11th century by sundanceone can you tell
1:53:49
us what it was yes but perhaps before i do that i ought to explain to our listeners what an
1:53:54
ontological argument is what's meant by the word ontologically that is that in the uh middle ages and later there were
1:54:00
two different kinds of arguments offered for the existence of god uh one set of which the best known of
1:54:06
the five ways of saint thomas aquinas they take as their starting point some
1:54:11
feature of the external world usually some very obvious feature of the external world as that some things move
1:54:18
from place to place or that some things come into existence and go out of existence starting with those and
1:54:24
a few universal truths of philosophy saint thomas will offer to prove to you that there is something which is
1:54:30
recognizable as what all men called god they're cosmological arguments because they begin from the cosmos
1:54:36
but the ontological argument uh is a kind of argument which is meant to begin just from the notion of god
1:54:42
from the very conception of god you don't as a way have to go outside the realm of ideas to get its starting point
1:54:50
now the as you said the uh most uh well-known formulation of it is that of
1:54:55
centencell indeed sinhanselm seems to have been the inventor of the ontological argument whereas the other
1:55:01
arguments are developments of things to be found in aristotle now anselm's argument is very ingenious
1:55:10
it takes as its starting point a definition of god
1:55:15
he says well god is is something that you can't conceive anything greater than
1:55:21
now that seems a pretty harmless definition of god and somebody who didn't believe in god might might accept
1:55:27
it as a definition and after all if you don't believe in something you need a definition of what it is you don't believe in
1:55:33
and so an atheist might agree all right i accept that definition of god as something that you can't conceive anything greater than
1:55:40
well then anselm will say to the atheist well let's suppose that
1:55:46
that god only exists in the mind and not in reality of course you've got to agree that god exists in the mind because
1:55:52
you're thinking of him at this very moment and that's a way of him existing in the mind but now if god existed
1:55:59
only in the mind and not in reality then you could conceive of something greater than god
1:56:04
because you could conceive of something that was exactly like the god you're just conceiving of only existed in
1:56:10
reality as well as in your mind and that would be greater therefore there would be something
1:56:16
greater than god but god was something that couldn't be that then which you could conceive nothing greater and
1:56:22
you've just conceived of something greater than god that's an absurdity it's something self-contradictory
1:56:28
what led us to this uh contradictory result was the assumption that god existed only in the mind and not in
1:56:35
reality therefore we have to say that god exists in reality as well now that's the sort of argument that
1:56:41
when one hears anyone intelligent nowadays who hears it is almost bound to think well there's something wrong with
1:56:46
this but the disconcerting fact is that when you try to put your finger on precisely what it is that is wrong with it it's
1:56:53
very difficult to do so isn't it yes i agree with you i'm one of those who think there's something wrong with that argument but it's not any
1:57:00
particularly modern uh vision of philosophy that makes people think there's something wrong with the
1:57:05
argument some thomas aquinas spends quite a bit of time trying to prove to you that there's something wrong with that
1:57:10
argument he wasn't convinced by it either but the most interesting thing is that a lot of the great philosophers
1:57:17
through history have thought there was something wrong with the argument they all give different reasons for saying what's wrong with it and to this day
1:57:24
there isn't any consensus about what is wrong with it indeed there isn't any consensus that there's something wrong
1:57:30
with it at all and there is a recently has grown up in america
1:57:35
a group of philosophers of religion using the latest techniques of
1:57:41
mathematicized logic to revamp the argument and to try and present it in a way which is
1:57:48
convincing within the background structures of contemporary logic it would take too long and i would
1:57:55
need a blackboard to spell out how they do it but it's something which when i was
1:58:01
first coming to philosophy was thought of as completely dead duck it is now alive and living in indiana and in
1:58:07
california yeah earlier you were drawing certain parallels between medieval philosophy and modern philosophy i mean and uh
1:58:14
you've given us another one now with interest in the revival of interest in the ontological argument you were saying
1:58:20
earlier that um logic in the middle ages was language centered uh
1:58:26
well yes just to a large degree logic and language centered and that's again true now though it wasn't true for much
1:58:33
of the period in between and there seems to be another way in which philosophy now can be
1:58:39
likened to philosophy then and that is that after a long period in which moral
1:58:45
philosophers not concerned with specific problems of
1:58:50
living but were concerned with the analysis of logical arguments and concepts and so on they are now coming
1:58:57
back to being concerned with what philosophers call first order problems now that was so in the middle ages
1:59:03
wasn't it for most of the time this again is a fairly recent change in
1:59:08
the anglo-american philosophy that you and i were brought up in i think at the time when we were
1:59:14
starting philosophy we would be told that the it wasn't the task of the moral philosopher
1:59:19
to tell you whether it was ever permissible to tell lies or whether there was anything wrong with adultery
1:59:24
or what were the criteria by which you would decide whether a war was being justly and fairly waged and so on
1:59:32
these were thought to be matters of importance no doubt but not the business of the philosopher the
1:59:37
philosopher's task was a second order task it was to analyze the language and
1:59:43
concepts which we use to make these first order decisions whereas in
1:59:49
the last decade i think there has been a great swing of interest back to the real live moral questions as
1:59:57
being something which concerns philosophers as philosophers not just as citizens or
2:00:02
moral human beings there's been an enormous input from philosophers into questions of medical ethics for instance
2:00:09
questions of the preservation of life and of such questions as when it is right to turn off lights of life support
2:00:15
systems uh whether it's right to experiment on embryos and so on after all in this country it was a philosopher
2:00:22
mary warnock who chaired the committee of inquiry into that there's been in particular um
2:00:29
an interest in the relationship between moral philosophy and the waging of
2:00:34
warfare i'd like to i'd like us to take this up because you yourself have written a book recently about nuclear
2:00:40
deterrence and one question to which you have to address yourself with central to to your
2:00:46
book is are there any imaginable circumstances in which nuclear war would be justified
2:00:52
and you refer to the whole medieval tradition of discussion of the just war and you say in your own book that you
2:00:59
think that any intelligent person ought to take an interest in these arguments can you tell us something about what
2:01:05
they were yes the the theory of the just war is something of which there's the germ in the middle
2:01:11
ages in aquinas and in later thinkers it gets more developed just after the end of the middle ages
2:01:17
in the post-medieval scholastics but it is the question about in what
2:01:23
circumstances uh is it morally right to wage war and if you go to war
2:01:29
what moral constraints are there on the way in which you wage war on what you choose as targets what you do with
2:01:36
prisoners and things like that now the the theory of the just war is a theory in the middle between two
2:01:42
opposing views on the one hand there's the pacifist view that there's no such thing as a just wall all wars are immoral and
2:01:50
wicked no matter how noble the causes are for which they are waged on the other hand there's what you might
2:01:55
call the view that no wars are unjust that is that though war is a terrible thing once you get
2:02:01
into war there are no moral rules at all the only moral imperative is just to win the war
2:02:06
by the most effective possible means now the tradition of the just war says no
2:02:13
neither of those are true there are some values that are more important than life itself and therefore
2:02:18
values for which you can legitimately make war but within war they have to be
2:02:24
constraints uh the there have to has to be a a good reason for going to war the
2:02:30
values for which you go to war have to be ones really important enough to defend in that way and when you go to
2:02:35
war there are constraints on what you choose as targets there must be no deliberate killing of the innocent
2:02:42
whether by the innocent you mean civilians not involved in the war making or
2:02:48
ex-combatants who are now prisoners and so on now it's very interesting i think that this medieval just war tradition
2:02:56
lies behind two of the most significant contributions to the debate recently about nuclear weapons in this country
2:03:03
the church of england's book the church and the bomb and in the united states uh the pastoral
2:03:09
letter of the american catholic bishops on the use of nuclear weapons and
2:03:14
nuclear deterrence much of what you've been saying refers though you didn't mention the name to
2:03:20
the work of thomas aquinas isn't it the case that aquinas is now as it were the
2:03:25
official philosopher of the roman catholic church i think we've just about come to the end
2:03:30
of the period in which it that could have been said before the 19th century though he was
2:03:35
held in enormous respect i don't think he was in any way the official philosopher of the roman catholic church
2:03:42
he was perhaps the official philosopher of the dominican order but that's only a small part of the catholic church then
2:03:47
in the late 19th century pope leo the 13th wrote an encyclical letter giving him a
2:03:53
special place in the teaching of philosophy and theology in catholic seminaries and universities
2:03:59
since the second vatican council i have the impression that the hold of
2:04:05
aquinas on catholic institutions has become much looser and he's been replaced largely by other
2:04:11
philosophers i think not always by philosophers who are um better not not not always better but i
2:04:18
think in fact the reputation of aquinas in the non-catholic world has enormously
2:04:23
gained from the fact that he's now no longer seen as just the spokesman for a party line
2:04:29
and particularly in the united states there's a growing interest in his work by people who aren't catholics perhaps
2:04:34
aren't even christians at all who are just impressed by the sheer philosophical genius of the man
2:04:40
i'd like to take up one other question which is always of interest to people outside philosophy as well as in it and
2:04:47
which was of special interest to philosophers in the middle ages and that concerns the question of what what
2:04:53
extent we have free will in the middle ages it was particularly
2:04:58
important to christian thinkers because of the doctrine of grace the doctor according to the doctrine of
2:05:05
grace it it simply is not up to us as individuals whether to secure our own
2:05:10
salvation i mean whether or not we will be saved depends at least in part on divine grace but if that is so
2:05:18
then to what extent do we have free will in any respect that matters i mean that that was in a way the nub of the problem
2:05:25
can you tell us something about that well there were two problems in the middle ages interwoven but one of them a
2:05:31
philosophical problem and won a theological problem the philosophical problem was the
2:05:37
problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge and human freedom
2:05:43
because not only medieval philosophers but most ancient philosophers and islamic
2:05:49
philosophers who had considered the nature of god thought that one of the things that we
2:05:55
knew about god if we knew anything about him at all was that he could foretell the future that he knew what was going
2:06:00
to happen in the future well of course if we're free if you and i are free it looks as if what you and i decide to do
2:06:06
today is what determines what's going to be the future tomorrow but if god already knows what you and i are doing tomorrow
2:06:13
how can we be free to decide that today now that's a problem which
2:06:20
arises for anybody who believes in an omniscient god at all whether or not they believe in anything that the bible
2:06:26
says about god but there was a special problem for christians especially for christians who
2:06:33
took the version of christianity presented by saint augustine because saint augustine particularly in
2:06:39
his later days lays enormous emphasis on the fact that on the doctrine that nobody
2:06:46
achieves salvation goes to glory in heaven unless they're predestined to do so
2:06:52
by god and that was an extra problem for christians but what is interesting philosophically is that the patient work
2:07:00
which was done by the theologians and philosophers in the middle ages
2:07:05
unraveling the concepts of freedom and the concepts of determinism to try to show that the tour can be reconciled
2:07:14
these are replicated often in ignorance today by people who are not interested in god at all but are interested in
2:07:20
determinism and physical scientific determinism but the actual logical moves
2:07:27
which somebody in the 20th century will use who's trying to reconcile physical
2:07:32
determinism with our experience of freedom will be the same steps being gone
2:07:37
through as somebody in the 14th century trying to reconcile divine predestination with human freedom
2:07:44
alas we're going to have to draw this discussion to a close if uh anything that we've said stimulates some
2:07:51
of our viewers to go off and try and read some medieval philosophy no doubt in most cases for the first
2:07:57
time in their lives have you any advice that you give them about where to start
2:08:03
i think that they there are not many medieval works which are easy for beginners this
2:08:10
is because of what i said about it most of the great works being within a university tradition they are entirely
2:08:16
universal highly technical university textbooks but there are two short books that one could pick out
2:08:22
the first is the one you yourself began with augustine's confessions i think that's a wonderful work well it's one of
2:08:28
the greatest autobiographies ever written and i think it's probably the first autobiography in the modern sense
2:08:34
ever written it's full of a great deal of personal reflection of
2:08:41
tender memory of his family of
2:08:47
insight into his own childhood and his own development but it also moves on to
2:08:52
the most abstract levels of philosophizing at the end of it raising questions about the nature of time which
2:08:59
are still very much a lie the other book which i would recommend
2:09:04
is the pros logion of saint anselm which is the book in which he presents
2:09:11
that ingenious argument for the existence of god that i tried to paraphrase earlier on i think your
2:09:16
readers might find this interesting to to look at that book it only takes an afternoon to read and see whether they think i represented
2:09:22
his argument rightly and see whether they find it convincing i said right at the beginning of this discussion in my
2:09:28
introduction that for a long time medieval philosophy has been the cinderella of the subject and there's no
2:09:33
doubt that that has been true in the past but i'm also beginning to get the impression of that that and your own
2:09:41
writings are perhaps one of the swallows that presage this summer that there are all the signs of a
2:09:47
revival of interest a serious revival of interest not quite perhaps with us yet but on the way
2:09:52
do you perceive that of course it's only true of anglo-american philosophy
2:09:59
that medieval philosophy has been a cinderella on the continent medieval philosophy has been thriving for as a
2:10:06
subject of study for quite a long time i think that the revival in english-speaking philosophy at the
2:10:13
moment is particularly in america where there's a great revival of interest in all things medieval not just
2:10:19
in medieval philosophy thank you very much anthony kennedy thank you
Bernard Williams on Descartes
2:10:25
when the term modern philosophy is used in universities it's usually to make a distinction from ancient and medieval
2:10:31
philosophy so it doesn't mean just the philosophy of our own day here in the 20th century it means the philosophy of
2:10:38
the last four centuries in fact there's one man who is generally and i think rightly regarded as the inaugurator of
2:10:45
modern philosophy the frenchman descartes so in practice what the term modern philosophy means is philosophy
2:10:52
from descartes onwards rene descartes was born in france in 1596 he received an unusually good
2:10:59
education but he also had unusual independence of mind and while still young he perceived that the various
2:11:06
authorities he was studying quite often put forward arguments that were invalid
2:11:11
as a young man he became a soldier and traveled widely in europe though without seeing any fighting and he was struck by
2:11:18
the fact that the world of practical life was as full of contradictions as the world of books he became fascinated
2:11:25
by the question whether there was any way at all in which we human beings could get to know anything for certain
2:11:31
and if so how he stopped travelling and went into seclusion in holland the country in
2:11:37
which intellectual life in those days was at its freest and there during the 20 years from 1629 to 1649
2:11:46
he produced work of the profoundest originality in mathematics and philosophy and also did a great deal of
2:11:52
work in science he invented the branch of mathematics known as coordinate geometry it was his
2:11:59
idea to measure the position of a point by its distance from two fixed lines so
2:12:04
every time we look at a graph we're looking at something invented by descartes in fact those two familiar
2:12:10
lines on a graph are known by his name they're called cartesian coordinates
2:12:16
cartesian being the adjective from the name descartes his most famous works of philosophy are the discourse on the
2:12:23
method which was published in 1637 and the meditations published in 1642
2:12:30
he never married though he had an illegitimate daughter who died at the age of five he always had an eye to his
2:12:36
own dress was proud of being an officer and on the whole preferred the company of men of affairs to that of scholars
2:12:42
but during the years of his creative work he lived a very solitary life when he was 54 he was prevailed on by
2:12:49
queen christina of sweden rather against his will to go to stockholm and become her tutor in philosophy
2:12:56
it was a mistake in the bitter swedish winter he succumbed to pneumonia and he died in the following year 1650.
2:13:04
with me to discuss the work of this first of modern philosophers is the provost of king's college cambridge
2:13:10
bernard williams author of a well-known book on descartes bernard williams i think the best way we can begin is to
2:13:16
try and get clear in our minds what it was that descartes thought was the main
2:13:22
problem he was going to have to confront when he started now what was that i think he'd been impressed by
2:13:29
the education you referred to in his experience of the life around him with the idea that there was no certain
2:13:36
way of acquiring knowledge it looked as if there were some sorts of knowledge around
2:13:41
but there was no reliable method by which people could advance knowledge i think it's very
2:13:47
important that to put it in a historical context that one realizes that science in our sense
2:13:53
really didn't exist i mean the concept of science in our sense as an organized international enterprise with research
2:13:58
methods and laboratories and all that simply didn't exist and there was room for an enormous range of opinions about
2:14:05
what chances there might be of ever being on a science of there being a science i mean on the one hand
2:14:10
there were people and perfectly sensible people who thought that if you just found the right fundamental method you
2:14:18
could solve all the fundamental problems of understanding nature in a very short while for instance francis bacon the
2:14:23
english statesman thought that that you'd be able to get everything on the right road in a very brief
2:14:28
period on the other hand there were people skeptical people who thought you
2:14:33
couldn't find any knowledge at all that there wasn't going to be any knowledge that everything was up for grabs as it were i
2:14:40
think one particular reason it's quite important actually why there was so much skepticism around was actually a result
2:14:45
of the religious reformation that after the religious reformation there are all sorts of claims made about
2:14:52
how you found out religious truth and they all conflicted with one another and there was no way of deciding between
2:14:58
them and that gave rise to a tremendous amount of controversy in which people said
2:15:04
and enemies of all religions said well there simply isn't a way of solving any of these questions all these people disagree with each other you can't put
2:15:09
it on the foundation and then religious people sort of reacting against that in turn
2:15:14
said well religion is no different than this from anything else there isn't a way of putting anything on a firm foundation so
2:15:20
that skepticism was quite an important current in the intellectual climate of descartes time coexisting in an odd way
2:15:28
with very extravagant hopes of what science might be able to do and for instance might be able to do for mankind
2:15:33
through what we would now call technology for instance there were great hopes that there could be a scientific medicine and the scientific industry and
2:15:40
so on but nobody quite knew how to do it for a fundamental innovator like descartes the institutional setup must
2:15:46
have presented problems too mustn't it i mean almost every serious institution of learning or study or teaching was in the
2:15:53
hands of an authoritarian church whose own intellectual leaders were for the most part enthrall to ancient
2:16:00
authorities that is that is certainly true of course there were many different religious influences as as we just said i mean
2:16:07
that one effect of the reformation had been that some seats of learning had more of a protestant complex complexion
2:16:13
while obviously those in descartes in paris had a catholic uh complexion and so on but of course the point you
2:16:19
mentioned about authority is very important although there had been a good deal of research into what we would now
2:16:25
call mechanics or kind of mathematical physics in the middle ages and we shouldn't forget that fact a great deal
2:16:32
of what was would go by the way of being science was actually in the form of commentary on
2:16:38
ancient books above although not exclusively those of aristotle and one thing that descartes and others of his generation absolutely knew was that
2:16:46
historical authority was not the same thing as it were first order research or inquiry so in other words what one can
2:16:53
say is that descartes in starting out on his famous search for certain knowledge
2:16:58
was really looking for a way of moving forward from the situation that you've just outlined i mean he was looking for
2:17:05
a research program as we might say in modern parlance and prior to that a research method yes i think that that's
2:17:12
that's perfectly correct description situation it's very important as one further fact which conditions all of his
2:17:17
work and which one finds the thread through it was that science was not conceived as a shared or
2:17:25
joint or organized enterprise as it is now for us it's just taking for granted
2:17:30
that science means scientists there are a lot of people and they communicate with each other and there's a division
2:17:36
of labor it's a division of intellectual labor at that time in the first half of the 17th century
2:17:41
it was still a reasonable project for one man to have the idea that he
2:17:46
could lay the foundations of all future science and descartes who did really fundamentally believe that it was not as
2:17:53
it were a piece of megalomaniac insanity on his part as it would be in the modern world for anybody to have that idea now
2:18:00
in my introduction to this discussion i said that descartes became fascinated by the question of whether there was
2:18:06
anything that we could know for certain he was clear from the outset wasn't he that certainty and truth are not the
2:18:13
same thing and that the i mean to put it at its uttermost crudity uh
2:18:18
uncertainty is a state of mind truth is relates to the way things are out there in your world
2:18:25
but he seems to have thought that uh you could only be know that you've got the truth so to
2:18:31
speak if you also had grounds for certainty so that his method was not only going to have to be one which
2:18:36
delivered the goods in the form of worthwhile conclusions but also gave him
2:18:41
a way of defending them against skeptical arguments so now how did he
2:18:47
go about meeting that double barrel requirement well descartes had a set of conditions on inquiry um and some of
2:18:54
them were just sort of sensible rules about dividing questions up into handleable amounts trying to get your
2:19:00
ideas clear and things like that but it had got this very characteristic and important rule for him that you
2:19:06
shouldn't accept as true anything about which you could entertain the slightest doubt
2:19:12
now of course as you said on the face of it that isn't an immediately sensible rule because in
2:19:18
ordinary life we're constantly seeking true beliefs about things but we don't necessarily want to make those beliefs
2:19:24
as certain as possible one thing we'd have to invest too much effort into making the ultimate you know ultimately
2:19:30
certain beliefs all the time but descartes who was trying to get at the foundations of science and also not only
2:19:37
the foundations of a science itself in the sense of fundamental general truths about the world but also to lay the
2:19:44
foundations of inquiry that is to be able as he thought to lay the
2:19:49
foundations of the possibility of going on to find out more things to establish that scientific knowledge was actually
2:19:55
possible for him he felt that it was absolutely essential that you should start the search for truth with a search
2:20:01
for certainty that what he wanted to do was to be able to put the scientific
2:20:07
enterprise as we would put it into a shape in which it could no longer be attacked by skeptics
2:20:14
so the first thing he wanted to do was to engage in a kind we might call it preemptive skepticism in order to put
2:20:21
the foundations of knowledge beyond skeptical reach he said to himself i will do everything the skeptics can do
2:20:28
only better and what i can do by pressing the skeptical inquiry hard enough is he hoped come out the other side with
2:20:36
something which would be absolutely foundational and rock hard and one of the most characteristic features of
2:20:42
descartes is not that he confuses the idea of looking for truth and the idea
2:20:48
of looking for certainty he saw they were two separate separate things but he thought that the only sure way of
2:20:55
searching for truth was by starting by searching for certainty and that led
2:21:00
him didn't it to the famous cartesian doubt yes as a method not not the
2:21:06
discourse on the method that's not that's about something else but but doubt used as a method was
2:21:12
fundamental to his procedure he adopted something that he called the method of doubt and indeed the method of doubt is
2:21:18
part of the method which is discussed in the discourse on the method but only one element in it that's that's the situation there now the method of doubt
2:21:25
worked but since he was looking for certainty by laying aside anything in which he could find a doubt as he
2:21:31
famously put at one point it's like having a barrel of apples and some of them are bad and some of them are sound
2:21:37
you want to keep adding the sound ones so you take them all out first look at them one by one throw away the ones that
2:21:43
are dubious and put back only the absolutely sound ones so he started by emptying his mind of
2:21:49
all beliefs laying aside anything in which he could see the slightest died and the way he did that was really in
2:21:55
three stages he started by laying aside things which just an ordinary common sensical grounds you
2:22:00
might possibly find doubtful for instance he reminded himself of such well-known facts as sticks can look bent
2:22:06
in water or you know things can look curious colors to you if you have defects of eyesight and certainly
2:22:11
obvious things but he wanted to go beyond those absolutely so everyday kinds of doubt or grounds of doubt the
2:22:18
next step he did was to entertain the idea that perhaps we could doubt that we were really
2:22:25
awake and seeing things around us as we ordinarily suppose for instance he just entertained the following thought
2:22:31
he had often dreamt that in the past that he was perceiving things while he was dreaming
2:22:37
at the time he was dreaming he thought just as he does now that he was
2:22:42
seeing people or tables or whatever around him but of course he woke up and found that was all an illusion how could
2:22:48
he be certain that at this very instant he wasn't dreaming well
2:22:53
that's an unnerving kind of skeptical consideration it had been used by skeptics before but he gave it an
2:22:59
orderly and settled place in his inquiry now of course the dream doubt the doubt based on the dream
2:23:05
does depend upon knowing something it depends upon knowing that in the past you've sometimes woken up and found you
2:23:11
and dreaming i mean it depends on the idea you know something about the world for instance that sometimes you sleep
2:23:16
sometimes you wake sometimes your dreams on he then took another step he said i will imagine i will go to the most
2:23:22
extreme doubt possible i will imagine the idea of a malign spirit sort of evil spirit a
2:23:30
malicious demon as it's sometimes golden literature whose sole intent is to deceive me as much as he can and then i
2:23:37
put myself the following question suppose there were such a spirit is there anything he couldn't mislead me
2:23:43
about and this is of course is a pure thought experiment it's an abstract thought experiment we must emphasize that
2:23:49
descartes never meant this philosophical doubt to be a tool for everyday living
2:23:54
he makes that point over and over again the the the method of doubt and particularly the fantasy or model of the
2:24:02
evil spirit is used only as a form of intellectual critique in order to winnow out his beliefs and
2:24:09
see whether some are more certain than others and of course the ultimate uh purpose
2:24:14
for his long-range strategy of winnowing away everything that he can possibly in
2:24:19
any imaginable circumstances doubt is to find rock hard indubitable
2:24:25
propositions which can then function as the premises for arguments is that so
2:24:30
well as two things i mean he wants to find he certainly wants to find rock-hard indubitable propositions let's
2:24:36
say the propositions which in some sense which of course requires a bit of inquiry to what exactly is cannot be
2:24:41
doubted which in some sense cannot be doubted which will resist the doubt he wants them in part as premises of
2:24:48
arguments he also wants them in some rather more general role as to provide a kind of background which will validate the
2:24:55
methods of inquiry i was referring to before and we pets can say something about how that works yes but now after
2:25:01
peeling away all imaginably doubtable propositions what are the utterly
2:25:07
indubitable ones that well the famous thing that he arrived at that what the some french commentators
2:25:13
call the turning point of the doubt that's where the doubt has got to the end it does a u-turn and he starts coming back again constructing knowledge
2:25:20
again the point at which it stopped was the reflection that he was himself engaged in thinking
2:25:27
as he said the malicious demon can deceive me as he will he can never deceive me in this
2:25:34
respect namely to make me believe that i am thinking when i am not
2:25:39
because if i have a false thought well that's a thought so in order to have a deceived thought i've got to have a thought so it must be true that i'm
2:25:45
thinking and from that descartes uh drew another conclusion or at least he immediately associated with that another
2:25:51
fundamental truth namely that he existed and so his fundamental first proposition
2:25:57
or two propositions really was i am thinking therefore i exist or cogito ego
2:26:02
sum in the latin formulation or as it's often called the cogito that's that it's worth making the point that he himself
2:26:09
uh made it clear that by thinking he didn't just mean conceptual thought he
2:26:14
meant all forms of consciousness absolutely right experience feelings etcetera etcetera cogito in this latin
2:26:21
formulation equally for descartes french formulations means all sorts of things like perceptions and pains and so on not
2:26:28
just uh so it wouldn't be unfair to say that what he was saying was i am consciously aware
2:26:34
therefore i know that i must exist that's it he does actually
2:26:41
in the great work called the meditations in which this is most carefully and elaborately set out he does actually
2:26:49
show a great deal of finesse in pushing the boundaries of the cogito forward
2:26:54
step by step through various kinds of mental experience but the some of what he gets to is exactly that yes now in
2:27:01
the process of peeling away everything that can possibly be doubted in order to arrive at these fundamental indubitable
2:27:08
propositions he himself has shown that from these fundamental propositions
2:27:13
nothing follows that although i am consciously aware i may draw all sorts of false inferences
2:27:20
about for example the external world or whatever it might be from whatever the deliverances of my own consciousness are
2:27:26
so i'm conscious only i mean i can be sure only of the fact that i am having
2:27:32
whatever immediate experiences it is i am having i can't be absolutely certain of any inference i may make from that
2:27:39
well it depends what sort of inference it is what he thought was that the mere fact that i have the experience as it were of
2:27:46
being confronted with this table for instance doesn't guarantee the existence of that table
2:27:51
i mean that was got rid of even at the dream state of the duct and of course it's even more got rid of by our friend
2:27:58
the malicious demon who is maybe i might just have this experience and nothing actually be there so i can't immediately
2:28:04
infer from my experience what descartes tries to do is to construct now a set of
2:28:10
considerations which will enable him to put the world back though it has to be it has to be said
2:28:15
straight away that the the form in which the world is put back is rather different from that of common
2:28:21
sense we don't just as it were having moved all the furniture out of the attic in the course of the day stuff it all back again in a totally unreconstructed
2:28:28
form we have a different view of the world when we reconstitute it
2:28:34
than we did in our everyday common sense experience and incidentally we'll come to how he does that but it's a very
2:28:39
important fact about the method of doubt that that is so it's extremely important because
2:28:45
sometimes sometimes people talk about descartes doubt as if all he did he had a kind of gratuitous doubt
2:28:50
and then sort of put the whole world back again afterwards but it's very important that not only does he put it back for very special reasons but that
2:28:57
what he puts back has actually been subtly modified by an intellectual critique of how we can know things
2:29:04
but now how he puts it back i was going to say the point that i'm concerned to get at now is that he seems in arriving
2:29:10
at his indubitable propositions to have painted himself into a corner because he's given himself indubitable
2:29:16
propositions which he himself has shown at a previous stage of the inquiry
2:29:22
can't be used to infer any certain truths about the existence of anything outside myself well he's all he's seen
2:29:29
at the earliest stage of the proceedings is that the most obvious way of inferring the world from them isn't
2:29:35
valid he's now going to give you a way which he claims is now of course some people think that this actually is a bit
2:29:40
of a conjuring trick and that he actually tries to get himself out of the corner to which he's painted by the well-known hero of the thriller novel
2:29:47
you know likely he threw off his bonds but i mean this is how it works he now
2:29:52
having as you rightly say got to the point of which he is only the contents of his consciousness
2:29:57
which he is acquainted with there's nothing else available to him it's obvious he's going to put the world back he's got to do it entirely out of the
2:30:03
contents of his consciousness so he's got to find something in the contents of his consciousness which leads outside himself
2:30:11
and he claims that what this is is the idea of god he discovers among the contents of his
2:30:16
consciousness the conception of god and he argues that this is unique among
2:30:22
all the ideas that he has among all the things that are in his mind this alone is such that the mere fact that he has
2:30:29
this idea proves that there is really something corresponding to it that is say there really is a god
2:30:35
that's a very difficult one for many modern reasons of course in fact he has two different
2:30:41
arguments both of which he uses in the meditations for doing this one is an old medieval argument called the ontological
2:30:47
argument which is uh i think perhaps we needn't spend time on that that is a kind of logical puzzle i think a
2:30:53
metaphysical puzzle but it's it's much less characteristic of descartes the one that's really characteristic of descartes is the argument which says i
2:30:59
have this idea in my mind but i see an absolutely intuitive necessary principle
2:31:05
which is the lesser cannot give rise to the greater the less i cannot be the cause of the
2:31:11
greater now my idea of god is the idea of an infinite thing
2:31:17
and although it's only an idea in itself it's nevertheless the idea of
2:31:23
an infinite thing it involves the idea that i can conceive an infinite being
2:31:29
but no finite creatures i know myself to be could possibly have given rise to such an idea the idea of an infinite
2:31:35
being it could only have been implanted in me by god himself as he memory puts
2:31:41
it at one point as the mark of the maker on his work god as it were signed me by leaving in
2:31:48
this infinite idea of god himself when i reflect the lesser cannot give rise to
2:31:54
the greater in this way i realize that since i have this idea of god it can only be because there actually is a god
2:32:01
who has created me so he's then put in the position of founding our knowledge of the external world upon a belief in
2:32:08
the self-evidentness of the existence that's right it's absolutely central the
2:32:13
the arg the next bit then goes that it it works like this he then says i the
2:32:19
things i know about this god i know that he exists i know that he's omnipotent i know that he created me and i know that he is benevolent these are of course all
2:32:26
traditional christian beliefs and because god created me
2:32:32
and is benevolent he is concerned as much with my intellectual welfare as
2:32:38
with my moral welfare and what that means is that if i do my bit
2:32:44
and that's very important and i clarify my ideas as much as i should
2:32:49
and i don't ascend precipitately to things i haven't thought out properly if i do my bit in that sense then god
2:32:56
will validate the things which i am then very strongly disposed to believe now i find
2:33:02
that however much criticism i make of my ideas however carefully i
2:33:07
think out what is involved in my beliefs about the physical world and all that kind of thing although i can suspend
2:33:13
judgment in the doubt i wouldn't have got to this point if i couldn't although i can suspend judgment in this doubt i
2:33:19
do have a very strong tendency to believe that there is a material world there
2:33:25
and since i have this disposition i've done everything in my power to make sure that my beliefs are not
2:33:31
founded on error then god will at the end as it were make
2:33:36
sure that i am not fundamentally and systematically mistaken that is there is such a world
2:33:42
so you know by ending up arguing in effect that the world of science is given to us by
2:33:48
a god whose existence is self-evident and whose benevolence is self-evident
2:33:54
he's so to speak not so much answered the skeptics about science has jumped
2:33:59
over them and he's bypassed well what he says is that he it's absolutely essential to his position that he
2:34:05
believes that these arguments that involve god will be assented to by any person of
2:34:12
good faith who concentrates on them enough that's absolutely essential he he cannot accept it it would ruin his
2:34:19
whole position if you accepted the idea that whether you believe in god is a matter of cultural psychological
2:34:24
upbringing and perfectly sensible people can disagree about whether the god or not however hard they think about it it
2:34:30
is essential to descartes that to deny the existence of god confronted with these arguments
2:34:36
is as perverse and as totally and bad faith as it would
2:34:42
be to deny that tries two is four and therefore the idea is that if you lead the skeptic properly through it and the
2:34:49
skeptic is an honest man that is not just mouthing words or trying to impress and you put these proofs before him he
2:34:56
must at the end ascent now people have not done this because
2:35:01
they haven't thought hard enough they haven't split it into they haven't done it in an orderly manner a lot of the skeptics are in fact fakes who simply go
2:35:08
around making a rhetorical position don't really think about it but if you're in good faith and think hard enough about it
2:35:14
then you will come to see this truth and then you cannot consistently deny the
2:35:19
existence of the external world that's what he believed now one very important outcome which this set of arguments had
2:35:26
was that of positing a world which consists fundamentally of two different sorts of
2:35:31
entity there's the external world which is as it were given to me by a god on
2:35:36
whom i can rely but there's me who is observing this external world
2:35:42
and he made a great point again in this earlier stage of the argument when he's stripping away all the
2:35:49
propositions that he can possibly doubt of saying that when he's considering himself and the
2:35:55
nature of his self he can even imagine himself existing without a body that's
2:36:01
right but he can't imagine himself uh not having the the thinking awareness
2:36:07
yeah that's the point about the i am thinking being indubitable right that's right so one consequence of that is that
2:36:13
you get a world positive which consists on the one hand of thinking entities
2:36:19
which are locationless and substanceless and a world a material world which this
2:36:26
thinking entity is thinking about or observing and it's a world of
2:36:31
observer and observed mind and matter uh spirit and material
2:36:38
which has become built into the whole western way of looking at that that's absolutely right but now uh descartes ultimate aim from
2:36:46
the beginning has been to establish the project of science or of what we could call science the project of what we
2:36:52
would call science and by the arguments that you've outlined he's now arrived at a certain view
2:36:59
of the external world now how is this external world to be treated scientifically now that that
2:37:06
remember i mentioned earlier that when god we through the help of god we put the world back again we didn't put back
2:37:12
quite the same well that we've thrown away that it's criticized in the process and in our reflections we come to the
2:37:18
collusion not only this is an external world the external world just as my essence as a thinking thing is simply
2:37:25
thought the external world has an essence too and that's simply extension it simply takes up space that it's susceptible to
2:37:32
being treated by geometry and the mathematical sciences all it's as it were colorful aspects i
2:37:38
mean the fact that it's colored that there are certain tastes and sound these are really subjective they're on the mental side they're subjective things
2:37:45
that occur in consciousness which are caused by this physical extended geometrical world he had an example
2:37:52
which i think it's worth mentioning it's a very good one about a piece of wax he said if you take a piece of wax it has a
2:37:58
certain size and shape in your hand a certain color smell texture feel temperature and so on
2:38:05
and it seems to us to be the combination of those properties if you put the same piece of wax in front of a fire it
2:38:11
immediately melts and then all those things change different color different smell different temperature different
2:38:17
everything and yet we want to say it's the same wax now what about it what is there about it
2:38:24
that's the same answer i suppose that there's a continuous history of space occupancy
2:38:31
yes there is as you know there is a great uh one of the disputed things in uh
2:38:37
expanding descartes is what exactly he thought the wax argument proved and how much he thought it proved just by itself
2:38:43
but he certainly did use that example to illustrate if not actually to prove uh what he thought was the fundamental
2:38:49
idea that is it where space occupancy just being a piece of space yes and it's
2:38:54
rather important but curious he did actually not think he really did think a piece of space he
2:39:00
didn't think he was just a thing in space because he didn't believe in a vacuum he really did think that the whole world
2:39:07
was one extended item and that separate item things in it as we say tables or
2:39:12
whatever really are local pieces of this in certain states of motion now this is a foundation for the mathematical
2:39:18
physics of the 17th century in its own terms didn't come off i mean eventually
2:39:24
it was going to be replaced by the classical physics and dynamics of newton which had a different conception of a
2:39:30
mathematical world but it did a tremendous amount to establish the notion of a physical world which is
2:39:36
fundamentally of a mathematical character and permits mathematical physics to be done because one of the
2:39:43
most important and striking facts about the scientific revolution starting in the period we're discussing in descartes
2:39:48
lifetime and through his work is that the first of the great sciences as it were to get going was in fact
2:39:54
mathematical physics chemistry there's as well the things that deal with sorts of things in that
2:40:00
much more that kind of detail is of course much more product of the 18th and 19th century and not not of the 17th
2:40:05
century but wouldn't it be fair to say that descartes in his time did more to
2:40:10
launch the possibility of science and to as it were cell science to the educated
2:40:17
public than anyone else yes i should have thought that was probably true i mean the figure who is all also
2:40:23
enormously favored famous and who's as a matter of fact whose actual physics is
2:40:28
nearer to classical physics as it came out in the end is actually galileo rather than descartes but of course
2:40:33
galileo was more notorious perhaps than respectable because he was tried and condemned by the inquisition and so on
2:40:40
uh yes i mean descartes intellectual influence in this respect was simply enormous even though the details of his physics were eventually to be in good
2:40:46
part reputation now up to this point in the argument what descartes has shown descartes hasn't as it were provided us
2:40:53
with any physics what he's shown is that a mathematically based physics
2:40:59
is possible and is applicable to the real world yes can you expand on that distinction a little bit yes absolutely
2:41:05
he what he hopes to have shown by the maneuvers we've been through we've followed so far
2:41:10
is that as it were the world is so constructed that man is capable of knowing about it i mean in that sense
2:41:17
man and the world are made for each other by god there is still a teleological thing at the end in god
2:41:24
even though of course man in his essence is not actually part of nature because man is this immaterial intellectual
2:41:30
substance which isn't part of the natural thing man is not part of nature in that sense but he uses it where his
2:41:36
intellection is quite well adjusted to it and that means we can conduct a mathematical physics above all now
2:41:42
descartes thought that some of the fundamental principles of physics could themselves be known by what we would
2:41:49
call philosophical reflection he thought in particular we could know by such reflection that every physics
2:41:55
had to have a conservation law there had to be something that was conserved we
2:42:00
talk about the conservation of energy the conservation of force and so on uh descartes destructibility of matter
2:42:06
as it used to be thoughts of course now we know the equivalence of matter and energy so through atomic reactions and so on now
2:42:12
descartes actually picked on the quantity it was conserved something which wasn't what was conserved indeed in terms of classical physics later is
2:42:19
not even well defined but the idea was there and that was a priori it was to be known by reflection
2:42:25
further details of the laws of physics he thought required investigation and in
2:42:30
particular how the world was actually laid out how different patterns of motion were to
2:42:36
be founded he thought was a matter for experimental inquiry now this is quite important because people descartes is
2:42:42
rightly said to be a rationalist philosopher that is that he thinks that fundamental properties of the world and
2:42:49
of the mind and so on can be discovered by reflection by a kind of philosophical reflection and he does not think that
2:42:56
everything is just derived from experience or experimental thing it's sometimes supposed that he was such
2:43:02
a strong rationalist that he thought that the whole of science was to be deduced by purely kind of mathematical
2:43:08
or logical reasoning from metaphysics that if i said and thought hard enough about the cogito and god and matter and
2:43:14
all that i'd arrived with that with the whole of science he thought no such thing in fact he's absolutely consistent
2:43:20
always in saying that experiments are necessary to distinguish it in some ways of explaining nature and others you can
2:43:25
build different models this is very modern very modern aspect of his thought you can build as or construct different
2:43:30
intellectual models of the world within his laws experiment is needed to discover which are truly there yes and
2:43:38
is experiment seen by him as designed to test the answers or to give us the
2:43:43
material for the premises to our argument it's designed for a number of different things actually but really the
2:43:50
following that if you take the fundamental laws of nature the principles on which matter moves there
2:43:55
are a lot of different mechanisms you could imagine which would produce superficially the same effect you then
2:44:01
make differential experiments you then arrange a setup in which one thing will happen if one
2:44:07
model is what's really there and it won't if another is and so you select between models and that's really is a
2:44:13
quite a good description of quite a lot of what physicists do well it's the modern notion of the crucial order
2:44:18
and he was very keen on that one of the things that descartes was admirable about was that it was simply no good blundering around the world trying to
2:44:24
explain and see what you could find out you had to ask the right question and that's again this thing we were saying
2:44:31
god is on your side if you do your bit god will not allow you to be systematically deceived if you don't
2:44:37
systematically deceive yourself so what you've got to do is to think of the right questions to
2:44:43
ask and then god will assist nature and giving you the answer i think it's worth making the point at this stage in the
2:44:48
discussion that although uh god is an absolutely indispensable element to descartes in the course of arriving at
2:44:55
his method once you've got the method you don't have to be any sort of believer in god to use it no do that
2:45:02
that is an exceedingly important point the descartes wanted to free the process of science
2:45:08
from theological constraints or foundations or as one might say free it from theological foundations and hence
2:45:14
from theological interference but of course he was extremely keen to say this does not mean that we've
2:45:20
produced a godless world we've produced a world which is in fact made by god and where our knowledge of
2:45:26
it is guaranteed by god but where you have to appeal by god to god in your intellectual life
2:45:33
is not in as you rightly say in conducting science but improving to skeptics that it can be conducted and
2:45:40
descartes very sensibly thought you shouldn't spend a lot of time in proving to skeptics that it can be conducted but need to do it once he thought he'd done
2:45:46
it now let's all get on with it because now one uh phrase that's commonly used for an aspect of this whole system that
2:45:53
he provided us with is cartesian dualism we've talked about this already i mean the mind body yes the the the division
2:46:00
of total reality into spirit and matter yes now didn't this give him a theoretical problem of a very important
2:46:07
kind how did he explain the interaction i mean to put it very clearly how is a spirit
2:46:12
able to push objects in the world around yes well i'm afraid frankly the answer is that he never really did
2:46:18
i mean leiden it's somewhat scornfully said on this subject the interaction said mr descartes seems to have given up
2:46:24
the game so far as we can see he did have a theory in a late work just before he went to sweden he wrote a book in
2:46:31
which he did curiously try to localize the interaction between mind and body in
2:46:36
the pineal gland which is the body at the base of the brain but of course it barely even makes sense i mean the idea
2:46:42
that this purely sort of abstract non-material item something which is almost there not quite as the category
2:46:49
of a number could induce a change in the physical world by redirecting certain animal
2:46:54
spirits which is what he believed is so difficult to conceive even in sort of an abstract principle that
2:47:01
it was a kind of scandal for everybody i mean a lot of the philosophy of the 17th century and indeed subsequently actually
2:47:08
addressed itself to trying to find some more adequate representation of the
2:47:13
relation of mind and body than descartes actually left us with nevertheless some form of cartesian dualism of distinction
2:47:20
between observer and observed subject and object got into western thought for something
2:47:26
like 400 years i think the distinction between subject and object uh nowhere
2:47:32
and known is a distinction which is simply impossible for us to do without i mean there are indeed philosophical
2:47:37
systems that constantly try to say that we simply have no conception of the known independently of the noah we make
2:47:42
up the whole world but of course the trouble about that is that it's very difficult well i mean
2:47:48
complete idealism the idea that everything's there is really a product of our minds is pretty little simply quite difficult
2:47:56
to believe and we all do and certainly all science does depend very much on a
2:48:01
dualism between the knower and the a world which we can know independently of our process of
2:48:08
knowing it what i think very few people now are sent to is the absolute dualism
2:48:13
between a completely pure mind and the body the the the noah has to be seen as
2:48:18
indeed of course it was in philosophy earlier than descartes for instance bison thomas or by aristotle the noah
2:48:25
has to be seen as an essentially embodied creature him or herself as it were i mean
2:48:30
yeah and not just as a kind of pure soul what would you say its main
2:48:35
influence on western philosophy has been uh i mean descartes influence has been
2:48:40
simply immense yes and still is well if we summarize it in one thing is it is that descartes and almost descartes
2:48:47
alone who brought it about that the center of western philosophy for all these centuries has been the theory of
2:48:53
knowledge the idea that philosophy starts from the question what can i know not from the
2:49:00
question just what is that or how is the world but what can i know not just what can i know
2:49:06
but what can i know that is that it starts from a first personal eco-centric question and it is
2:49:14
very important for the structure of descartes system i mentioned right at the beginning that it was possible in
2:49:19
his time to think that perhaps science could even essentially be done by one person but even if you lay that
2:49:24
historical context aside it is very important part of his enterprise that it is it is autobiographical it's no
2:49:31
accident that these two great works are discussed on the method above all the meditations are written in the first person
2:49:37
they are works of self philosophical self inquiry and this
2:49:42
first personal and epistemological aspect that is i aspect concerning the theory of knowledge has been the overwhelming influence of descartes
2:49:49
now given that that the all the things that are wrong with the philosophy that we've touched on and of course there are
2:49:55
more than we have touched yes and given that the central concern of philosophy has now moved away from the
2:50:01
problem of knowledge which was made central by descartes why is the study of descartes now as
2:50:09
valuable to a city as it is i mean if i may put this problem in this question in a personal way you bernard williams
2:50:15
you've spent as far as i know almost 20 years of your life working on a book on descartes you must have thought this
2:50:22
enormous investment of yourself and your life was worth it why
2:50:27
um i think for two reasons i mean there are let's lay
2:50:33
aside the purely case of historical understanding the role that descartes has played in getting us into our
2:50:38
present situation where i think that just to know what he said in a little bit of detail is very important simply
2:50:43
to understand who we are and where we've come from but the reason why i think that this book when i say this book
2:50:48
above all i mean the particular book called the meditations is a book that one very much if one's interesting
2:50:54
philosophy wants to read now is because the path it follows the path
2:50:59
of asking what do i know what can i doubt and so on um is presented in an almost irresistible
2:51:07
way and the point is it's not an accident that this emphasis in philosophy has been so overwhelmingly
2:51:12
important it isn't that jay cut just because he was a dazzling stylist or something of that kind could kind of perform a long distance mesmerism
2:51:20
on the mind of europe that isn't the reason the reason is because he discovered something which is
2:51:26
intrinsically compelling that is the idea that i can ask myself well i have
2:51:32
all these beliefs but how can i get round behind my beliefs to see if they're really true how can i stand back from my beliefs to
2:51:39
see which of them are prejudices how much room for there is in skepticism these are really compelling questions
2:51:46
and it needs an enormous amount of philosophical imagination and work to get oneself
2:51:51
out of this very natural pattern of reflection and another very related question which comes before you very
2:51:58
dramatically in this extraordinarily written book it's not just what can i know but as we discovered
2:52:04
already in the cogito what am i we can imagine ourselves we have this
2:52:10
power of imaginative extraction from our actual circumstances we can imagine
2:52:15
ourselves looking out on the world from a different body we can imagine looking into a mirror and seeing a different
2:52:22
face and what's important looking into a mirror seeing a different face and not being
2:52:27
and this gives us the idea a very very powerful idea that i am independent of
2:52:33
the body and the past that i have and that is an absolutely foundational experience of the cartesian idea
2:52:41
that i am somehow independent of all these materials cartesian dualism though once you look at it as it were sideways
2:52:48
as a theory it's immensely difficult to believe for the reasons that we've touched on it also has about that it's
2:52:55
almost impossible to resist if you go at it through a certain set of reflections and i think the set of reflections that
2:53:01
descartes with unexample clarity and force lay before you to lead you down
2:53:06
that path as i think mistaken path are so not only powerful in themselves but as
2:53:12
it were near to the bone that it is a prime philosophical task to
2:53:17
try and arrive at an understanding of oneself one's imagination one's conception of what one might be that one
2:53:24
would free one of that dualistic model thank you very much
Anthony Quinton on Spinoza and Leibniz
2:53:30
for a long time now it's been usual to see western philosophy in the 17th and 18th centuries as divided between two
2:53:37
opposing schools british empiricism and continental rationalism the chief of the empiricists
2:53:43
being lock barclay and hume and the chief of the rationalists being descartes spinoza and lightnings
2:53:49
of the many issues that divided them the most important put at its crudest was this
2:53:55
the rationalists believe that we human beings can acquire important knowledge of reality by the use of our minds alone
2:54:02
by thinking by pure reason the empiricists denied this they insisted that experience was always a
2:54:10
necessary ingredient and that all our knowledge of what actually exists must in the end in some way or other be
2:54:16
derived from experience the traditional view has been that these two opposing schools finally came
2:54:23
together at the end of the 18th century and were combined in the work of emmanuel kant
2:54:29
in this program we're going to take a look at spinoza and leibniz the two greatest of the rationalist philosophers
2:54:35
after descartes the first in time was spinoza born in amsterdam in 1632
2:54:41
his family were portuguese jews who in the aftermath of the spanish inquisition emigrated to holland in search of
2:54:48
religious freedom spinoza was brought up and educated in an enclosed jewish community
2:54:54
but he rebelled against religious orthodoxy and at the age of only 24 he was excommunicated by the jewish
2:55:00
authorities fortunately for him he was a loner by temperament as well as circumstances and he chose a solitary
2:55:07
mode of life in order to do his work when he was offered a professorship at heidelberg university he turned it down
2:55:15
he earned his living grinding lenses for spectacles microscopes and telescopes and it's believed that the daily
2:55:21
inhaling of glass dust from this occupation aggravated the lung ailment that killed him at the early age of 44.
2:55:29
acknowledged masterpiece a book entitled ethics but in fact dealing with the
2:55:34
whole range of philosophy came out after his death but in the same year 1677
2:55:41
a striking feature of this book is that it's modeled directly on euclid's geometry starting from a small
2:55:48
number of axioms and primitive terms it proceeds by deductive logic to prove a
2:55:53
long succession of numbered propositions which taken together lay out the total
2:55:59
scheme of reality it's often held up as the supreme example of a self-contained metaphysical
2:56:05
system whose object is to explain everything in only the year before his death
2:56:10
spinoza had a series of meetings with the other philosopher we're going to consider lightnings one of comparatively
2:56:16
few instances of two of the greatest philosophers actually meeting each other and having face-to-face discussions
2:56:23
as a personality leibniz was a complete contrast to spinoza courtier and diplomat always traveling honored in
2:56:30
many countries he was one of the great polymaths of our culture it was he who coined the notion
2:56:36
of kinetic energy he invented calculus not knowing that newton had already done so and published it before newton did in
2:56:44
fact it's his notation not newton's that we used to this day and he was among the great philosophers
2:56:51
leibniz was born in leipzig in 1646 and died in hanover at the age of 70 in the
2:56:56
year 1716. so brilliant was he as a student that he
2:57:01
was offered a professorship at the age of 21 but like spinoza he turned it down
2:57:07
though for the opposite reason he wanted to be a man of the world he spent most of his life at the court
2:57:13
of hanover in the service of successive dukes one of whom became king george the first of england founder of the present
2:57:20
british royal family leibniz carried out almost every task imaginable for a
2:57:25
person in such a position and his philosophy was as one might put it written in his spare time
2:57:31
he wrote an enormous amount mostly in the form of quite short papers but published scarcely any of it during his
2:57:38
life he also maintained a voluminous international correspondence which is now a philosophical importance
2:57:45
among his outstanding works are the monadology the discourse on metaphysics
2:57:50
and a book called new essays concerning human understanding which is a point-by-point argument with his english
2:57:57
near-contemporary john locke to discuss the work of leibniz and spinoza i've invited someone who is well
2:58:04
known both as a philosopher and as a historian of philosophy anthony quinton
2:58:09
chairman of the british library formerly president of trinity college oxford anthony quinton for clarity's sake i
2:58:16
think we're going to have to deal with our two philosophers separately but before we start doing that is there
2:58:21
anything that can be said usefully about them jointly well i think there is the one you've
2:58:27
mentioned already it's a standard piece of tidy convenient classification
2:58:32
they're the three rationalists who face the three british empiricists these two opposed triads of thinkers
2:58:40
descartes spinoza leibniz they do have a community of style and purpose descartes
2:58:47
defined the terms laid down the agenda but in a sense the world that they can't produce by the exercise of pure reason
2:58:54
or the conception of the world that they can't produce is a fairly straightforward affair he does
2:59:00
preserve the self in a recognizable form the human individual he in the
2:59:06
natural straightforward terms of his age produces god even if it's not a terribly human sort of god
2:59:12
and he preserves the material world in a broadly speaking recognizable form even
2:59:18
if deprived of some of its more vivid and colorful and odoriferous attributes
2:59:23
but the world's created by the application of the procedure of rationalism the one you mentioned you
2:59:29
start from some self-evident propositions like a person producing a system of geometry and then you carry
2:59:35
out processes of absolute uh straightforward deduction from these
2:59:40
self-evident propositions what that led to in the case of spinoza and leibniz is something very far
2:59:48
removed in both of them from the ordinary understanding of the world to some
2:59:53
extent descartes by comparison with them is in the business of saving the appearances
2:59:59
uh spinoza and leibniz both say what the world is really like is very different
3:00:05
from what it appears to the ordinary person to be but in both cases there is an underlying reality which philosophy
3:00:11
can tell us about even if common observation doesn't that's right and a very odd
3:00:18
world it is in each case i mean just to state in very brief terms what it is
3:00:23
they're in each of them it's so utterly opposed in the two cases yet they purport to be following the
3:00:29
same procedure and under what we might call broadly cartesian guidance
3:00:35
spidoza's world is a unitary world the there is only one true thing which is
3:00:40
the world as a whole which is both extended and in some sense mental
3:00:46
system of ideas on the other hand in leibniz's case the real world consists
3:00:51
of an infinity of things that are purely spiritual and everything material and space itself are phenomena appearances
3:01:00
byproducts as it were of the real world which is this infinite array of spiritual centers right well now let's
3:01:07
start taking them one by one and let's begin with spinoza it is this enormously elaborated single
3:01:15
system and it's often difficult to know where to break into a system where one when one wants to start expanding it where do
3:01:22
you think is the best place to start well there are a number of places you could begin i think one had better say
3:01:27
just a bit more about spinoza's method because he himself says that this book
3:01:33
ethics is demonstrated in the geometrical manner and as you mentioned in your remarks at the beginning he does
3:01:39
set it out with all the familiar apparatus of geometry things called axioms and postulates and definitions
3:01:46
and the end of each bit of argument uh fine has the letters qed as if it were a
3:01:53
straight piece of geometrical reasoning funny thing is that on the whole subsequent philosophers haven't taken
3:01:59
spinoza's reasonings frightfully seriously people don't think of him as a
3:02:04
reservoir of interesting arguments whereas they do think that of leibniz anyway so perhaps the method although it's the
3:02:11
most obvious feature this very explicit and conscious geometrical method is the real
3:02:16
stylistically obvious feature of spinoza's work it's not what's really important which is i suppose one must
3:02:22
say a vision and this vision is of the world as an absolutely
3:02:28
unitary entity any division of which is a mutilation of some sort of
3:02:33
misunderstanding he saw total reality as being one thing didn't he one
3:02:39
substance of which all apparently different objects and indeed people like
3:02:45
ourselves are merely facets merely modes merely aspects
3:02:50
this is a very difficult idea i think for most people to grasp at a first meeting can you unpack it a bit for us
3:02:57
well i don't probably the best place to begin is again i promise i won't go on doing this with descartes because they
3:03:03
can't define substance and the idea of substance and philosophy is a name for that that what it is that really exists
3:03:11
what the real components of the world are descartes defines substances that which requires nothing but itself in
3:03:17
order to exist and in terms of his view of things the only true substance therefore was
3:03:23
god because everything that existed apart from god and he thought that consisted of uh human souls and
3:03:32
material objects including the human body everything apart from god was dependent on god for its existence so
3:03:39
its substantiality its title to being substance was a little defective
3:03:45
god was the only absolute substance but from that point onward he didn't draw any further attention to it now you
3:03:50
could see spinoza as taking that point of descartes really seriously and saying
3:03:55
no there truly is only one substance only one thing which to use a free
3:04:01
translation of his own essential phrase for it is the explanation of itself only
3:04:06
one thing whose essence explains its existence whose nature it is to exist
3:04:13
and his conclusion was that the only thing of which that is true is the totality of what there is absolutely
3:04:19
everything and the one vaguely common sensical element in spinoza is to say absolutely everything the totalities the
3:04:27
one substance is in fact nature as well as god another argument that he used for that
3:04:34
derived from the the uh from god's infinite nature didn't it that if if god
3:04:39
was infinite there isn't anything that isn't god or to put the same argument the other way around if the world is
3:04:47
separate from god then god has boundaries god has limits god is finite
3:04:52
and not infinite for god to be infinite he must be coextensive with everything
3:04:58
that i think is probably as plausible a way as you could find of arguing for spinoza's position and it has
3:05:05
anticipations in earlier philosophy he goes through a good many other arguments to establish his general point
3:05:13
but what it really amounts to is there's only one thing whose explanation lies within itself
3:05:18
for everything else its explanation lies somewhere outside it and the odd thing
3:05:23
is this one thing all right so to one extent from one point of view it's nature the totality of what there is in space but
3:05:31
on the other hand it's god it's something broadly speaking mental and he
3:05:36
says god or nature is the true name of the one substance there is there's a big step isn't there
3:05:42
at least for us and i'm sure there must have been for him and his contemporaries too between seeing the whole of reality
3:05:48
as being a unity which is one idea and then seeing that unity as
3:05:54
being divine or as being god that seems a quite different step to take in the argument
3:06:01
what were his grounds for doing that well i suppose it was essentially it's god's perfection
3:06:07
that nature wasn't treated as some passive byproduct of god's activity but nature
3:06:14
was the totality of what there was the self-explanatory thing and so to that extent was a perfect
3:06:22
entity the most perfect thing there could be and therefore deserved the name god the only god if you like he was
3:06:28
prepared to countenance was a god that was identified with a whole array of natural things so summing up spinoza's
3:06:35
vision which was the very good word you used for it just now um he was saying in effect that if we
3:06:41
call the totality of everything there is nature then we can say in our terminology that
3:06:46
there is no supernatural supranatural realm
3:06:51
and also that god cannot be outside nature god must be co-extensive with the
3:06:58
totality of what there is if god is infinite that seems perfectly
3:07:04
reasonable no this would seem to solve one of the indeed
3:07:10
the most notoriously unsolved problem left by descartes which was the problem of how mind and matter interact with
3:07:18
each other descartes descartes work posed that problem but didn't really provide an acceptable solution to it
3:07:24
spinoza is now in a position to say well the problem doesn't really arise because in fact everything is is is a different
3:07:33
aspect of the one the one thing which is everything certainly the two things you mentioned
3:07:39
which constituted a special problem for descartes which he had a bold and highly unsatisfactory solution for
3:07:46
mind and body these are brought together in an ingenious fashion
3:07:52
by spinoza and it could be seen as often has been seen by historians of
3:07:58
philosophy that we should best understand spinoza's coping with that problem of descartes but i think that's
3:08:03
rather a limited conception of what spinoza is up to he's um he's after bigger game
3:08:08
than that a proper total conception of things what he says is in developing this thought that the one substance is
3:08:15
infinite he says not only does it contain everything and have nothing lying outside it which is a an idea close to
3:08:23
if not identical with the idea of infinity but the god or nature the single
3:08:28
substance the one substance the totality of what there is has an infinity of attributes now this sounds a little
3:08:35
puzzling and it is puzzling because as it turns out only two of these attributes are in any way accessible or
3:08:42
intelligible to us the others have to be taken on faith are it has the
3:08:48
rest of them but the two we know are the attributes of thought or consciousness on the one hand the attribute of
3:08:53
extension on the other and what uh spinoza maintains is that every wrinkle in the total fabric of one
3:09:02
the one substance these wrinkles he calls modes and they're
3:09:07
that is the proper understanding of what we think of as self-subsistent things tables chairs our wife's family whatever
3:09:15
it might be various identifiable items that have clear definite contours for spinoza
3:09:21
they're just temporary contours taken on by the fabric of
3:09:27
everything that there is like waves in the sea each of these is at once
3:09:32
uh conscious and extended and so there are the
3:09:37
phases or aspects or wrinkles as i call them of reality
3:09:44
are at one and the same time have these two aspects a mental aspect and a physical aspect therefore there isn't a
3:09:50
question of two utterly separated things happening to keep where in some cases in time with one another
3:09:56
to chime in with one another they are one and the same thing viewed from two directions
3:10:01
now we've both made much of the fact that spinoza presents his philosophy as if it were
3:10:09
euclidean geometry or on the lines of euclidean geometry now with a system
3:10:15
that is set out deductively in which everything follows from everything else there simply isn't any room for free
3:10:22
will is there what was spinoza's attitude to the whole free will question or the whole free
3:10:29
will problem well i think that can be put very clearly in a couple of sentences to start with
3:10:34
what he does maintain is that what he would probably call the everyday vulgar commonsensical notion of freedom that is
3:10:42
to say the idea that the human individual can sometimes act as a spontaneous uncaused cause of things
3:10:50
the freedom of pure spontaneity this he says is impossible it's simply an illusion that's engendered by our not
3:10:58
knowing what the causes of our actions are but on the other hand this is the other sentence spinoza says there is
3:11:04
such a thing as human servitude or bondage and that consists in being
3:11:11
induced to act by some causes rather than others there are some causes
3:11:17
we can call them generally speaking the passive emotions things like hatred and anger and so forth generated in us by
3:11:25
the frustrating influence of the world outsiders the parts of the world i better say that are outsiders and he
3:11:33
also believes that we have active emotions which are those generated by an understanding of our
3:11:39
circumstances in the world and knowledge of what's going on and the greater our activities are
3:11:46
caused by active emotions and the less by passive emotions the less
3:11:52
in bondage we are because we're more ourselves i think he was probably the first person in
3:11:57
european thought to introduce this very important idea which in a quite different form is made
3:12:04
much of a great deal later by freud and by psychoanalysis that discovering what
3:12:10
the hidden sources of your actions and emotions are will be in a sense
3:12:15
liberating will make you happier even if it doesn't literally increase your freedom
3:12:21
i think you're right i mean you could see spinoza's attitude to man's position in the world as a stoic one the
3:12:28
idea that the world around us is not particularly interested in us therefore we must
3:12:34
diminish its power to make us suffer by controlling the emotions it excites in
3:12:39
us that's a stoic idea but you're quite right in saying there's something more in
3:12:45
spinoza because it's not the idea by a terrific effort repressing or overcoming these
3:12:50
uh sad unfortunate passive emotions it's by the exercise of the mind
3:12:57
gaining an understanding of the world which just makes these emotions peter out or
3:13:04
fade away and their place come to be occupied by the active emotions the most
3:13:09
elevated of which as he describes it is what he calls the intellectual love of god
3:13:14
which is a rather mysterious business it's the emotion that attends a metaphysical understanding a total
3:13:21
comprehensive understanding of the world don't you think there's something paradoxical about the fact that he's
3:13:26
commonly thought of as a religious or quasi-religious thinker in view of the fact that he doesn't
3:13:33
believe in free will he doesn't believe in the immor immortality of the soul because he
3:13:40
doesn't believe that anything is permanently separate from anything else he doesn't even believe in the existence
3:13:45
of a personal god because he thinks that the divinity is identical with nature
3:13:52
is it right you think to think of him as a pantheist well i think it's right to think of him
3:13:58
as a pantheist but that to go back to what you said before to say that isn't to deny that he's
3:14:03
religious the thing is there's a very considerable correspondence between many of his views
3:14:10
and many of the views of the roughly contemporary british philosopher thomas hobbes but thomas hobbes was a
3:14:17
man of in some ways indestructible cheeriness but who thought the universe was a pretty gloomy setup
3:14:25
and was in fact despite some references to god i think fairly clearly describable in a literal way as an
3:14:31
atheist spinoza on the other hand his attitudes are religious it's one of awe and
3:14:37
respect for the universe at large and the thing is in our christian
3:14:43
civilization we make certain lay down certain requirements on the religious
3:14:48
attitude which are not universally applicable in other words it's parochial of us to deny that spinoza is a
3:14:55
genuinely religious person because the attitudes which in our cultural
3:15:00
background are normally adopted towards a personal wrathful interested god are in his case
3:15:08
adopted towards the whole scheme of things he's religious if you like in the way perhaps wordsworth is religious one
3:15:15
rather dramatic way he had of putting his identification of god with nature which appeals to me very much
3:15:21
is this he once said that uh it's quite right and proper that an individual should love god but it's absurd that he
3:15:28
should want god to love him it's as if a man were to love nature and expect
3:15:33
nature to love him back that's quite right we there's plenty of parallel for this kind of view of man's
3:15:40
place in the universe in the more elevated and sophisticated types of buddhism
3:15:46
but i think on reflection one has to admit that these are in their total place in the economy of human life these
3:15:52
attitudes are genuinely religious attitudes even if they're directed towards objects which are not the
3:15:58
familiar objects of religious attitudes in our culture do you think that spinoza was in any important degree influenced
3:16:05
in all this by his jewish background well i would have thought so because it just to make two very simple points or
3:16:12
perhaps three to take up your big kantian trinity of god freedom and immortality the jewish god is personal
3:16:18
all right but on the whole immortality is not very emphatically central to
3:16:23
jewish religion and freedom well perhaps there's freedom but in the general domain of the ethical
3:16:30
or the ethical relationship to god the jewish religion doesn't have a place for petitionary prayer for asking god to
3:16:38
do things for you the jewish view is one of grateful acceptance of what god offers one's not
3:16:45
always seeking favors from god as the christian is one accepts what god has to
3:16:51
give one in with such tolerance and submission as one can bring to bear and that is a very
3:16:58
spinoziest point of view well as you said earlier i think the thing for us to do with spinoza isn't isn't to attempt
3:17:04
to recapitulate the arguments but to convey the vision and i think you've done that very well and i think we
3:17:11
should now move to a discussion of our second philosopher leibniz who also had
3:17:17
a great big interlocking metaphysical system except that in his case he never
3:17:22
put it forward in one single work but it came out in bits here and there in different papers letters arguments
3:17:29
discussions and so on so that one has to as it were put it together for oneself
3:17:35
where do you think the best place to start with live myths is in trying to expand his system
3:17:41
well it's probably the case there were one writing a very very serious professional treatise online this one
3:17:47
would start in with certain logical doctrines he has but i think for the
3:17:52
comprehension of what he's up to in fairly short order the place one has to start is the idea of the monad his
3:18:00
notion of substance and of course as i mentioned earlier this is utterly opposed to spinozas because the monad is
3:18:06
something tiny i mean it's unextended in fact there'd be monads of all sorts god is a
3:18:12
monad yes i think you must give some kind of general definition of what a monad is well a monad is
3:18:19
leibniz's word for substance a single unit it has a number of properties
3:18:24
there's an argument the beginning of leibniz's monodology which is in fact not a very sophisticated
3:18:30
argument for as clever a man as leibniz he says whatever is complex is made up of what's simple and the simple
3:18:36
components of what's complex are the real constituents of the world and the complex are just a byproduct of the
3:18:42
aggregation of these symbols but whatever occupies space is extended is complex therefore the ultimate
3:18:49
components of the world as non-extended are non-material because not extended in
3:18:54
space therefore the real world is composed of an infinity of unextended metaphysical
3:19:02
points and each of these because non-material here he just relies crudely on descartes
3:19:08
if you like is therefore spiritual ergo the world consists of an infinity of
3:19:13
point like spiritual items mental items or as people sometimes say he himself at
3:19:19
times souls all the way from the most important of them the crucial one god
3:19:24
down through the human soul which is the particular monad where we get the idea of substance from in the
3:19:32
first place down to the the ultimate constituents of what we
3:19:38
conceive confusedly as matter i think this is such a lot for people to take in at once
3:19:43
that i'd like to go over the main points of it again leibniz is saying that everything that's complex must be analyzable into simpler
3:19:51
elements if the simpler elements are still complex then they must be further analyzable and therefore it must be the
3:19:57
case that sooner or later you come to simple not further analyzable
3:20:02
constituents of matter or the world or the universe or whatever it might be now
3:20:08
these simple constituents can't be material because the very definition of
3:20:14
matter is that it's something extended and extension is always sub-divisible so
3:20:20
if they're not further subdivisible they can't be extended and if they're not extended they can't be matter
3:20:26
so the ultimate constituents of reality must he thinks be something
3:20:32
immaterial and not occupying space i suspect that it's only our way of putting it up to
3:20:39
this point in the discussion that makes it sound as weird as it does because after all one of the uh most uh
3:20:46
influential doctrines of 20th century physics is that energy is the ultimate
3:20:52
constituent of the universe and that all matters ultimately constituted by
3:20:57
energy now it seems to me that leibniz was trying was groping towards in the vocabulary of
3:21:04
his day something very close to that that that he was trying to say that all
3:21:09
matter is ultimately made up of centers of activity which are not matter and i
3:21:15
think in the 17th century if you were trying to talk about centers of activity which are not matter the only vocabulary
3:21:22
available to people was the vocabulary of minds souls something of that kind do you think i'm
3:21:30
trying to falling over backwards to save him no not at all i think that leibniz is in many striking ways a very modern
3:21:36
thinker i mean when you read him it's a bit like reading the early virgin russell or fraga or the young
3:21:42
wittgenstein or something and one of the strikingly modern doctrines which i
3:21:48
think he was the first person to formulate clearly and which certainly plays a very
3:21:53
powerful role in philosophy to this day is the idea that all meaningful
3:21:58
statements must be of one of two kinds that a statement can either be true in the way that a definition is true that's
3:22:06
to say that if you say something like uh all bachelors are unmarried you don't
3:22:11
have to look you don't have to carry out a survey of the bachelors in society to see if that's true or not you know it
3:22:16
must be true by virtue of the meaning of the terms so all you have to examine outside the statement itself is the
3:22:23
rules governing the use of the terms in the statement but there's another kind of statement like for example there's a
3:22:30
monkey in the next room to find out that may be true or may be false it can be either
3:22:37
unlike the statement or bachelors are unmarried and the only way you can find out whether it's true or false is to go
3:22:43
and have a look in other words there are truths that must be true
3:22:49
because of the nature of the terms involved there are other truths which are or are not truths by virtue of the
3:22:55
way things are in the world and therefore they that can only be established by experience and leibniz
3:23:03
was i think i'm right in saying the first person thoroughly clearly to expound that dichotomy is that not so
3:23:10
that's perfectly correct you mentioned earlier that lot was a near contemporary there's a sort of adam bration of it in
3:23:16
locke but it's a bit misty in leibniz's case it's absolutely clear and lucid the distinction between what he calls truths
3:23:23
of reason on the one hand which it would be a contradiction to deny and truths of fact on the other hand
3:23:30
which it's not a contradiction or not evidently at any rate a contradiction to
3:23:35
deny the trouble is that under the pressure of his metaphysical commitments
3:23:40
the distinction between the two as it were evaporates at the margin
3:23:47
sometimes it's put by saying well there are finitely analytic statements or finite truths of reason which in a
3:23:54
finite number of steps can be shown to be such that it would be a contradiction to deny them and but truths of fact turn
3:24:01
out to be infinitely analytic in a certain sense if we never 100
3:24:06
we can't wake up yeah that they're that they're necessarily true or that there it would
3:24:11
be a contradiction to deny them in spite of the qualifications that you draw it would be difficult to think of
3:24:18
any philosophical doctrine that had been more influential in the last two or three hundred years no because you're
3:24:24
quite right because it was in terms of that distinction which he proceeded to muddle in a fruitful and interesting but
3:24:30
i would suggest ultimately mistaken way that can't set the main problem of his
3:24:35
own theoretical philosophy the critique of pure reason he wanted to say there was a third type of assertion over and above
3:24:42
truths of reason and truths of fact as described by leibniz and for a good deal of the 20th century in slightly
3:24:49
different terminology the distinction between those two things has been absolutely central to philosophy some
3:24:54
teachers of the subject when i was younger used to say whatever else one does to one's pupils if one gets that
3:25:00
distinction across to them it's been worthwhile they're studying the subject and that i think you're quite right in
3:25:06
saying was put onto an altogether new level of clarity and explicitness by leibniz sometimes because of our
3:25:13
somewhat parochial britishness we tend to attribute this doctrine to hume and it is in hue and he probably did work it
3:25:19
out for himself on the basis of pointers from lock as you say but the fact is that leibniz said it half a
3:25:25
century before hume and said it very clearly and said it over and over again the thing about hume is it's done in a
3:25:31
kind of drawing room relaxed rather imprecise manner the nature of
3:25:36
the distinction isn't very precisely worked out whereas in leibniz's case a
3:25:42
great deal of energy is expanded on making it quite clear what the logical foundations of distinction are yeah
3:25:48
another thing that leibniz offers us is a solution again to the descartes problem of interaction a solution to the
3:25:56
problem of how mind and matter interact and his solution is entirely different
3:26:02
from spinoza solution can you tell us what it is yes i mean insofar as it is a
3:26:07
solution it's rather like preventing oneself losing a chest by kicking the table over because in effect he says the
3:26:14
matter is not real matter is phenomenal and so there isn't any matter
3:26:20
in itself for mind to interact with all everything that really exists is in some degree or
3:26:27
other mental in nature at the lower end very rudimentary at our end quite
3:26:34
sophisticatedly mental and of course perfect in the case of god who is a purely mental being not at all the
3:26:42
extended all-inclusive physical entity of spinosa system
3:26:47
now if he thought that there was in fact nothing sufficiently materially real to
3:26:53
interact how did he explain apparent causality because the world does in fact
3:26:58
seem to consist of things interacting with each other well let me give you the short answer first because it's going to
3:27:04
provoke i think a further question i mean the short answer is here are all these this infinite array of mind-like
3:27:11
entities which constitute the universe and he says each of these and this is actually what he says each of these has
3:27:17
a perception very often a very obscure confused and limited perception of all
3:27:23
the others it has a point of view on the whole world now each of these uh inner worlds of
3:27:29
perception the picture of the world formed in each of these spiritual centers one should make it
3:27:35
clear that these include us is correlated it's different from but
3:27:42
correlated with uh the perceptions of others like a whole lot of photographs taken of a scene from different points
3:27:48
of view they all of a wedding group some of them that show the back of the head some of them the side some of them from the front but
3:27:55
all the same persons can be identified well likewise every individual monad has its own perspective on the world
3:28:02
now leibniz's view is that there is in fact no interaction between monads there's merely a correspondence
3:28:09
between their contents each monad has its own inbuilt history which develops
3:28:16
one quality succeeds another in the history of the monad but
3:28:22
part of the content of the monad a very principal part of the content of each monad is its awareness of other monads
3:28:28
and they are um correlated by what he calls a pre-established harmony
3:28:34
and sometimes he uses this as an argument for the existence of god that there is a pre-established harmony perhaps he needs god to show that there
3:28:40
is such a thing i mean this seems to be a attaching overwhelming importance to god in the scheme of things that god
3:28:48
created everything ordained the way everything is keeps everything going all
3:28:53
the time including us and therefore there is no need for a belief in causality i mean the very idea
3:29:00
of causality is it's a sort of extraneous or superfluous concept because god is doing it all all
3:29:07
the time and there's therefore as it were no way in which things can cause other things by interacting all is being
3:29:14
caused by god but in this picture how can free will come in because
3:29:21
leibniz certainly thought that he believed in free will in some sense that's quite right his arguments for the
3:29:27
existence of god are fairly traditional and conventional they have some slight new attachments or modernities about
3:29:33
them but on the whole they're very much like those of descartes and anselm and others further back in the history of
3:29:39
the subject but what he does with the idea of god is very striking i mean he carries the idea of god's omnipotence
3:29:46
a very long way and says god creates all the other monads that constitute the
3:29:52
world and equips them with an intrinsic nature which decides or determines everything they
3:30:00
subsequently do so everything as it were is prepared by god leibniz himself
3:30:05
doesn't see this this theory of programming as one might call it of all the contents of the universe which as
3:30:11
you rightly say rules out literal causality between one thing and another which is at best some
3:30:16
sort of correspondence or regularity of happenings in one and another
3:30:24
leibniz reconciles this as far as he can with free will and indeed quite well because
3:30:30
in a way what lack of free will is is to be caused to do things by something
3:30:35
outside you to be externally compelled to do something against the grain of your own real nature you might say well
3:30:43
in leibniz's picture of the world every individual's determining force once we get one on
3:30:49
from god so to speak is the nature with which god has equipped that individual so leibniz in a somewhat
3:30:55
debating society can where way could say in no system of the universe are individuals freer than in mine every
3:31:02
individual is perfectly self-determining what more could you ask for freedom but let me just make a more
3:31:09
sensible comment on that i mean i was throwing myself into the metaphysical idiom there
3:31:15
the thing is i it seems to me that it's very difficult for rationalism to allow for anything we'd recognize as human
3:31:21
freedom just because of its intellectual ambition it's determined to explain everything
3:31:27
but if everything has an explanation it looks as if that explanation is going
3:31:32
to be causal that everything that happens is going to be intelligible as part of some huge
3:31:39
unitary design or plan so there's no room for the toss of the coin and there doesn't seem any room for
3:31:46
any freedom of maneuver for the individuals in a world as conceived by rationalists
3:31:53
now uh you started by comparing spinoza and lightnings with each other now that
3:31:59
we've expanded their views at some individual length
3:32:05
each i'd like to come back to a joint question so to speak how would you assess their relative
3:32:12
contributions to the history of philosophy well they'd contribute to different
3:32:17
strands in it spinoza was much deplored in his own age the thing you questioned
3:32:22
his sincerity in his religious professions was very much questioned in his own age
3:32:28
people talked of the awful atheist spinoza frequently free thinkers like human baal did this and it wasn't until
3:32:35
the romantic movement in germany end of the 18th early 19th century with people
3:32:40
like herder and goethe that spinoza came more or less into his own
3:32:46
and he's always been an object of veneration because of his
3:32:52
personal dignity this um unworldly withdrawal from ambition and
3:32:59
self-affirmation and uh cutting a dash and all that that was utterly foreign to spinoza he's a person
3:33:04
of great sincerity his own activities his own life stories perfectly in accordance with his philosophic
3:33:12
doctrines and he's admired therefore but he doesn't appeal enormously to what one
3:33:17
might call the more technical kind of philosopher whereas i would be inclined to say of all the great philosophers of
3:33:25
the post-medieval world there is none who makes a more immediate appeal to the
3:33:30
technical philosophers at least of the anglo-saxon world in the 20th century because of his
3:33:36
unwarying professionalism his abstention from any form of rhetoric
3:33:42
it's noticeable that burton russell who wrote some 60 books only wrote one book about another philosopher and that was
3:33:49
about leibniz with whom i think he probably must have identified very considerably
3:33:54
but one thing that strikes me about both of them and i'd like to hear your views about this is something that is in a
3:34:00
sense unmodern about both of them is that they were both profoundly and sophisticatedly versed in
3:34:07
mathematics and indeed leibniz was a mathematician of genius and a mathematician mathematical physicist of
3:34:14
genius and yet both of them had this overwhelming concern with god and the
3:34:21
place of god in the scheme of things now i get the impression that there's a kind
3:34:26
of subtext to a lot of this philosophy that what they're actually trying to do
3:34:32
is to maintain a conception of the world which can accommodate the new mathematical physics of newton but which
3:34:40
has god in it do you think that's true yes i think that's that's certainly true
3:34:46
i'd just like to interpose first of all that despite all that mathematical looking apparatus in spinoza he wasn't a
3:34:52
mathematician really he'd studied little mathematics but he's in a completely different world from leibniz to as you
3:34:58
rightly say he's a major creative figure in the history of mathematics in spinoza's case it's rather like the
3:35:04
apparatus of pastoral poetry and a pastoral poet is not really an expert on
3:35:10
the culture of sheep or lamb rearing or anything like that at any rate but ignoring that but i think you're quite
3:35:16
right about there is a common topic that obsesses them in some way in which they both resolve in their very different
3:35:22
ways which is finding a place for religion in the
3:35:28
world as it had come to seem in the light of the great post galileo and after discoveries about
3:35:35
the nature of the physical world descartes technique was more or less to sell ground to say well the material
3:35:42
world is unthinking matter and that's where the galilean rules prevail but as
3:35:48
well as the material world there are individual human souls and there's god these are purely spiritual entities both
3:35:53
free both detached from though in various ways associated with the material world in other words it was
3:36:00
like splitting germany into two a demarcation that area is given to physics this area
3:36:06
is preserved for religion both spinoza and leiden itself have understandably dissatisfied with this
3:36:12
kind of solomonic carve up of the cosmic baby and are both anxious to combine religion
3:36:21
and science spinoza does it in effect by adopting the world picture of 17th
3:36:26
century science and then recommending religious attitudes towards the world so
3:36:31
conceived liveness the other way around wants to say um the world is in fact
3:36:38
much more as religion represents it a much more spiritual affair than science realizes
3:36:44
and yet we can rest the whole of the scientific conception of phenomena on an
3:36:50
essentially religious understanding of the world as the working out of the purposes of an infinitely intelligent
3:36:56
being namely god thank you very much anthony clinton
Michael Ayers on Locke and Berkeley
3:37:02
one of the most influential philosophers there has ever been was the englishman john locke born in 1632
3:37:08
he's been generally credited with laying the intellectual foundations both of liberal democracy and of modern
3:37:14
empirical philosophy an empiricist is someone who believes that our conceptions about what exists
3:37:20
can never pass entirely beyond the bounds of experience that everything we conceive of has either been experienced
3:37:27
or is constructed out of elements which have been experienced some version of this doctrine has been
3:37:33
accepted by many of the greatest philosophers since locke and philosophy in the english-speaking world has never
3:37:39
escaped its dominance for long so familiar has it become that many people nowadays regarded as obvious just
3:37:46
plain common sense but when locke propounded it it was an idea with revolutionary implications whether in
3:37:52
philosophy or the natural sciences or politics part of locke's message always
3:37:57
was don't blindly follow convention or authority look at the facts and think
3:38:03
for yourself in politics this was revolutionary in an almost literal sense in france it had a
3:38:09
decisive influence on voltaire and the encyclopedists and thus on the intellectual ferment that preceded the
3:38:16
french revolution in america the founding fathers hadlock consciously in mind and made repeated
3:38:22
references to him when they were drawing up the american constitution locke was educated at two institutions
3:38:29
that are still there and still famous westminster school and christchurch oxford where he became a don until his
3:38:35
mid-thirties he also qualified as a medical practitioner and when he left university
3:38:40
life he became involved in both politics and medical research in his own day he was occasionally known as dr locke
3:38:48
in the turmoil leading up to what the english called their glorious revolution of 1688 he had for his own safety to go
3:38:55
into exile in holland and he was one of those englishmen who followed william of orange over to england to oust the
3:39:01
stuart kings by this time he'd been working for years on what was to be his philosophical
3:39:07
masterpiece the essay concerning human understanding it was published in 1689 when locke was
3:39:13
57 but it had the date 1690 on the fly leaf and that's often mistakenly given
3:39:19
as the year of publication also published in 1689 was a letter
3:39:24
concerning toleration they're followed in quick succession the two treatises of government in 1690 and
3:39:31
some thoughts concerning education in 1693 although locked lived to be 72 and wrote
3:39:37
other things nearly all his influential writings came out in a period of less than five years
3:39:44
the next philosopher in the english language who is still of international reputation george barkley was in part
3:39:50
reacting against locke and it can therefore be helpful to consider the two together
3:39:55
barclay was born in ireland in 1685 and educated at trinity college dublin
3:40:01
all the philosophical works for which he's now famous were published when he was in his twenties a new theory of
3:40:07
vision in the year 1709 the principles of human knowledge in 1710 and three
3:40:13
dialogues in 1713. some of his other works deserve to be better known than they are but his fame
3:40:20
rests on those i've mentioned in 1734 he was made a bishop and to this
3:40:25
day he's often referred to as bishop barkley much of his life was spent in public
3:40:30
activity some of it in the new world he had connections with yale university where one of the colleges is named after
3:40:37
him and the town of berkeley in california is also named after him
3:40:42
he died at the age of 67 in 1753 and is buried in christchurch which of course
3:40:48
was locke's oxford college here to discuss with me the work of these two philosophers is someone whose
3:40:54
writings about them have made his academic reputation michael ayers fellow of wadham college oxford mr ayers let's
3:41:02
start with log if anyone's studying the history of philosophy chronologically as
3:41:07
many people do and so they come to lock via his predecessors one thing that's bound to strike them is
3:41:14
the number of central ideas in lock that had already been expressed by other people for instance by descartes i'm
3:41:20
thinking of the the notion of the whole world as being divided into minds and
3:41:25
matter as one example or the conception of the whole universe as one gigantic
3:41:31
uh mechanical system as another example what is it about lock that was
3:41:37
distinctively different well like descartes locke was part of a
3:41:43
movement um in the 17th century to oust
3:41:48
the previously dominant view of the world which was the aristotelian view
3:41:56
and central to this was of course the view of the world as a great machine subject
3:42:02
to mechanical laws i mean composed of lesser machines but all subject to the
3:42:09
same laws of physics necessary laws of nature
3:42:16
superficially too his theory of thought and knowledge can look like descartes
3:42:23
he explains thought as a series of ideas
3:42:29
before the mind an idea is something in the mind or
3:42:34
before the mind which represents things outside the mind in reasoning the mind
3:42:41
confronts these ideas so to speak or he's confronted by them and his his definition of knowledge is the
3:42:48
perception of a relation between ideas and this intuitionist
3:42:54
view of knowledge is can look very like descartes the view that in knowing something we as
3:43:01
it were grasp or perceive it's its nature
3:43:08
on the other hand there are very big differences his um chief among these perhaps or one of the
3:43:14
chief differences is the status the different status that he gives to the senses for descartes the
3:43:21
senses deliver certain data and they incline us
3:43:28
to have certain beliefs but these beliefs don't count as knowledge they have to be the senses have to uh
3:43:35
be um interpreted and uh explained by reason before uh we can
3:43:42
suppose that through the sentences we have acquired any knowledge of the word world basically the senses don't deliver
3:43:48
knowledge uh it's reason that delivers knowledge or the intellect operating on the data of sense but for
3:43:56
locke the senses themselves are a basic or fundamental faculty they
3:44:02
they deliver knowledge in their own right and this shows in the different approach to skepticism uh of the two
3:44:09
philosophers descartes so to speak accepts the skeptic's challenge to supply reasons for believing in an
3:44:16
external world in a world of objects outside us locke simply dismisses the challenge he
3:44:22
says that the skeptic is casting doubt on one of the fundamental
3:44:29
faculties of the human mind and yet he himself
3:44:34
in producing his skeptical reasoning is relying on human faculties and
3:44:40
in effect he rejects the whole thing he's prepared to say that if anybody is wild enough to be a skeptic reasons can
3:44:47
be produced but the senses don't need reasons i mean they just supply us with
3:44:54
um with knowledge another thing is uh that i think one must mention as being central to locke
3:45:01
is his very special use of the word ideas yes i know he didn't coin that but
3:45:06
he in chapter one of the essay considering human understanding he actually apologizes to the reader for the frequency with which he's going to
3:45:13
use the word in the book can you say something about that yes well he uh it was in fact a very
3:45:19
well used term by the time he used it i mean there's nothing really new about it at all but for locke an idea is
3:45:26
something very different from what it is for descartes but for descartes
3:45:31
it's something rarely fundamentally intellectual for locke it's fundamentally something sensory i
3:45:38
mean even if we're thinking about something that isn't we're not actually perceiving we have an image something a
3:45:43
sensory image of that thing and he explains even the most abstract thinking
3:45:48
in these terms of course his uh theory has to get more complicated at this point but basically
3:45:55
thought is for him the possession of having of images before the mind now this theory of
3:46:01
imagism as we could call it uh was not an uncommon one in the 17th century
3:46:06
and it had tended to have go in two one of two directions
3:46:13
one of these directions is taken by hobbes that since all our knowledge and
3:46:19
understanding was dependent on the senses hobbes produced a dogmatic uh view of the world which was a
3:46:25
materialist one um he thought that we could analyze experience in such a way that we could
3:46:30
arrive at the sort of understanding of the world that descartes thought we arrived at through the intellect but
3:46:36
locke took the different developed a different line of which is more agnostic or
3:46:43
skeptical really that although the senses give us knowledge they give us a limited knowledge and
3:46:50
because all our thought about the world is restricted to uh
3:46:56
the concepts that we have through the senses and in fact our thought involves sensory images uh that restricts our knowledge of the
3:47:02
world and he thought there was no method by which we could arrive at the underlying nature of things so
3:47:09
he was a sort of modified skeptic i mean we know the world is there but we don't know what it's like yes this use of the
3:47:16
word ideas and this particular theory of knowledge was so influential that i'd like to dwell on it just for a moment
3:47:23
and locke thought didn't he that everything that was present to the mind was in his sense of the word an idea and
3:47:28
he used that to mean not just thoughts as we tend to do but sensory images even memories pains
3:47:35
emotions yes everything immediately present to the mind was an idea now when it came to our apprehension of the
3:47:41
external world uh he thought that we didn't have direct access to objects i mean if i look at
3:47:49
that table i haven't got that table inside my head what i've got inside my head is a visual
3:47:57
image of that table the light shines from the table onto the retina of my eye that transmits an image to my brain and
3:48:04
i have the experience that i call seeing the table but the whole of my
3:48:10
experience through all five of my senses consists not of being in immediate
3:48:15
contact with the objects of the external world but of having images and representations of them
3:48:21
now he never doubted did he that although that means that the objects of
3:48:27
the external world out there are things of which i do not have and never can have immediate knowledge
3:48:34
he never doubted that they were out there did he i mean he no he believed that there were material substances out
3:48:40
there in the world giving me these experiences why was he sure of that
3:48:45
well uh he thought it just didn't make sense to suppose that all there is
3:48:51
so to speak a lot of sensible qualities i mean his model is that i mean there is the object there it's affecting us in
3:48:58
various ways and it's affecting other objects around it and it's through its effects on us and
3:49:04
through its perceptible effects on other objects that's to say the objects in turn affect us in regular ways
3:49:10
that's how we have knowledge of this thing and uh so what for us is simply we can we have to
3:49:18
think of simply in terms of a sort of list of sensible qualities and
3:49:23
powers to affect other things and so forth what's actually there is something really rather simple
3:49:30
but he believed that because he believed the world must make sense he believed that
3:49:35
the world is an intelligible place that it is uh governed by necessary laws and that it's
3:49:44
ultimately the kind of place that an ideal science could explain and understand now at the level of sense
3:49:51
perception although there are regularities there are only relative regularities i mean we don't get that
3:49:56
kind of absolute um law likeness at the level of ordinary experience
3:50:01
that um that would be the sign that we had arrived at the
3:50:07
truth of things it's it's because we don't have a simple comprehensive science really of things that uh he can
3:50:14
be sure that the senses don't uh give us knowledge of their nature but now you say that locke believed that the world
3:50:21
was the sort of place that a law-like science could explain but i think the question still needs to be asked if he
3:50:27
thought that all we all the knowledge we have of things is this intermediate knowledge that we we immediately
3:50:33
experience images and sensations and representations which in turn represent
3:50:40
or picture things if we never have access to the things how is a successful science possible on
3:50:48
lock's view how can we know what the nature of things is well it certainly is not possible
3:50:54
because we can never be sure uh he thought in his situation at any rate in the 17th century i mean he was really
3:51:01
trying to uh prick a lot of a lot of balloons so to speak i mean he was trying to cut the pretensions of of philosophers like
3:51:08
descartes who thought that they had rarely arrived at a deductive science of things
3:51:13
what we're restricted to in loxview is speculation and we're
3:51:19
not only are we restricted to speculation but we must employ in that speculation concepts that we get from
3:51:25
experience so there was in blocksview a very good speculation to
3:51:31
hand but there was clearly something wrong with it and that was boyle's view of the world as a whole lot of little atoms particles uh bouncing around and
3:51:38
and uh clinging together and and functioning mechanically and he thought that's what the world must be like that
3:51:44
it would be boyle's explanation of um chemical change for example but um
3:51:51
what if we take a chemical substance and we see that it behaves in a whole variety
3:51:56
of different ways in different conditions then boyle said well that's not because
3:52:02
it just so to speak has an a an arbitrary and contingent list of
3:52:08
powers to affect other things in various ways but because it has a certain structure a certain mechanical structure
3:52:14
and because it when it meets things of the different varying mechanical structures then obviously it's going to
3:52:19
behave in different ways when it when it interacts with these things um
3:52:25
now locke accepted that view provisionally uh but he thought there were certain
3:52:31
questions that left unanswered uh one of the questions concerned the particles
3:52:37
themselves i mean why do atoms cohere as little unchanging things it's all very well if you postulate them and then get
3:52:44
on from there but why isn't it the case that when one atom hits another it doesn't fall apart or bits fall off and
3:52:50
so forth um so the problem of coherence was one of the problems that he raised
3:52:57
um newton's pinkipia had been published just a few years before the essay and uh
3:53:04
of course the inverse square law is an important part of news i think i better mention what that is because some of our
3:53:09
viewers might not know and that is that every object in the universe attracts every other
3:53:15
object in the universe with a force which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
3:53:21
that's yeah yeah so well i mean just an interruption guy i think i mustn't assume that everybody knows this look
3:53:26
accepted that newton had shown that this law holds and he accepted that
3:53:32
um the probability also was that it holds absolutely universally yeah but nevertheless it seemed to look just like
3:53:39
a kind of brute fact and not in a really intelligible one in itself what science is explaining is not the inner nature of
3:53:46
things which which we can't know but how things behave which we can observe well he can
3:53:52
experience he he thought that that's what in the end that's what newton had achieved yeah a
3:53:59
sort of spectacularly good description of how things behave and this interpretation was one that newton
3:54:05
himself was inclined to yes and in fact in the second edition of the principia he
3:54:11
published afterlock's death he um introduced a number of philosophical passages which were pretty obviously
3:54:17
heavily influenced by locke yes he said this famous phrase i don't make hypothesis he's right hypotheses known
3:54:23
finger and he was referring to that wasn't he exactly i just tell you that there is gravity i don't try to explain
3:54:30
how it comes about that's right there is gravity and so on for the whole of his science yes one the new science made absolutely
3:54:36
prodigious use of mathematics and from galileo to newton and above all with newton
3:54:42
men began to understand that throughout the universe there are so to speak equations buried in reality
3:54:50
how did locke uh see this i mean how did he view the nature of mathematics
3:54:56
and through science its application to reality well his explanation of the possibility
3:55:02
of mathematical science and geometry in particular is quite uh really rather
3:55:07
different from descartes i mean descartes for descartes geometry is a part of the
3:55:12
science of space i mean it's it's a part of the science of reality but for locke it's uh a science an abstract science
3:55:20
which is created by us we so to be pick off um geometrical geometrical properties of
3:55:28
things and we can construct them ad-lib and we can create a sort of
3:55:35
science for that reason precisely because it's not really concerned with the nature of
3:55:40
things at all which is unknown it's simply concerned as it puts it with our own ideas yeah
3:55:46
when we observe things um they affect us uh in ways which cause us to observe as
3:55:53
we think properties in the things now locke thought that these properties were
3:55:58
all of two basic kinds isn't he that there were some properties in things which they possessed whether anyone was
3:56:04
observing them or not um he called those primary qualities yes
3:56:09
and that would include i suppose all the mathematical ones the measurable ones the mechanical the
3:56:14
mechanical ones like the dimensions and the weight and so on and there were other qualitative
3:56:22
properties like sounds and smells and tastes and colors but he thought depended on an observer we're beginning
3:56:29
to gather the materials together for a sort of outline sketch of a whole picture of the world and i'd like to
3:56:35
draw the threads together before we take any more forward steps it's really going back to the beginning
3:56:41
of our discussion and taking it up to this point that lock thought that the world as we experience
3:56:48
it consists of two fundamentally different sorts of entities minds and material objects
3:56:55
that we can't know what these are in their inner nature
3:57:00
and in their inner nature these remain permanently mysterious to us but we do have direct experience of of what they
3:57:07
do of how they behave one of the things that material objects do is affect us
3:57:13
they affect us through our senses in various ways which give us experiences
3:57:19
or representations or images of their properties and that we perceive their
3:57:24
properties of being again of two fundamental kinds there are the the primary qualities which are the
3:57:30
mathematical properties and the secondary qualities which are mind dependent and another sensory or
3:57:38
qualitative nature now this sort of view of the world is is extraordinarily close
3:57:43
it seems to me it's a one which is still very widely held and widely regarded as a sort of common sense view
3:57:51
up to this point in the discussion though we haven't said anything at all about one thing which is of enormous
3:57:57
importance to 20th century philosophers and was of enormous importance to lock
3:58:02
though we haven't mentioned it yet and that's language um lock the the essay concerning human
3:58:09
understanding is written in four books and one whole book is devoted to the use of words how did loch see language as
3:58:18
coming into or being related to our experience of the world well
3:58:23
i think i'd first like to just qualify you're summing up would you please do i don't
3:58:33
seem a little bit inconsistent oh did i uh because uh as a matter of fact it's true
3:58:40
he's inclined to think that the world is composed of matter and minds but he is consistent enough to say that
3:58:46
since we don't know the nature of either we can't even be sure of that so he is very important very further
3:58:52
ready to accept the possibility that materialism is true that that we
3:58:58
thinking things are in fact uh complex and subtle machines how we work we have
3:59:05
no idea at all but we he he's ready to accept the the the possibility that
3:59:10
there is no cartesian soul no um immaterial
3:59:16
uh naturally immortal soul actually i'm glad you pulled me up on that because he has an argument about
3:59:23
that which i think is marvelous and which i still think carries its full clout today
3:59:28
of us human beings he says that one of two things must be true but both seem to
3:59:33
us impossible to grasp either we must be material objects that
3:59:39
think and have emotions or there must be something immaterial in us which thinks and has emotions and is
3:59:46
in that case mysteriously allied to a physical object namely our
3:59:52
body now lock says when we try to think our way through these two alternatives
3:59:57
we find that both of them are in a profound way unintelligible to us and
4:00:02
yet one of them must be true yes i i i still believe that i think that's a good
4:00:07
argument yes the argument there is so strong that uh one wonders why on other occasions he says that dualism is
4:00:14
probably true but he never tells us why he said never justifies the problem well you were right to bring that in now
4:00:20
let me try and move us on as i did before to language how does locke's view of language uh fit in to his view of our
4:00:28
knowledge of the world well uh the book on language is really i mean book on classification in all the various
4:00:34
departments of knowledge what makes for good classification
4:00:39
the most interesting i think is is the classification of the natural world and what he wants to do here is to
4:00:46
reject the aristotelian view that the world is composed of natural kinds and
4:00:52
that science is a matter of identifying the natural kind and examining the nature of each
4:00:59
kind more or less separately so you have to study the essence or nature
4:01:06
of horses cows dogs cats are these categories in the world yes
4:01:12
and [Music] he wants to reject that view of course uh but this has implications of
4:01:19
classification for the aristotelian you say of course but somebody who hasn't thought about this before might not see the of course i mean i i mean aren't
4:01:26
there somebody might say but there are dogs or there are cows or there are horses well they of course came from what went
4:01:32
before because the the of course came from what went before because
4:01:38
given the view of the world as this great kind of mechanical object composed of lesser machines then
4:01:44
dogs and cats are little machines and they function according to the basic laws of physics
4:01:50
so there isn't a separate nature of dogs and a separate nature of cats there's a different structure but the
4:01:58
nature of the is in involved is really the same i mean the laws of nature
4:02:03
involved are the same um well uh
4:02:09
given that view i mean his own view of the world as that sort of
4:02:15
place yeah then uh
4:02:20
there could he he concluded that there were no natural divisions into kinds
4:02:26
that there were resemblances at the level of observation and these resemblances caused us
4:02:32
quite reasonably to slice the world up but in the end the slicing is done by us
4:02:38
it's not done by nature i mean for aristo for the aristotelian there are these natural divisions
4:02:43
natural species and we simply identify them and name them but for locke
4:02:50
we do the slicing up and the consequence of this is that the terms we use like
4:02:55
gold water uh horse dog and so on these are really
4:03:02
arbitrarily in the end arbitrarily defined by us they're human categories yes what would
4:03:07
he have said about his own distinction between minds and material objects that we've talked about so much so far i mean
4:03:14
isn't that a distinction of natural kinds isn't that found in reality and
4:03:19
not just a distinction made by us in language i think that would be i mean
4:03:25
if i think he would agree that if that were um if dualism were true if that's the way
4:03:32
it is then that would be a distinction of kind the the kinds that he's attacking are
4:03:38
the aristotelian kinds which are all um bodily i mean there isn't in the
4:03:44
astertilian philosophy um anything quite like the um the soul of descartes i mean
4:03:50
that immaterial object substance now if if lock thinks that our bodies are
4:03:56
ultimately mysterious to us simply because all material bodies are in their inner nature mysterious to us and we're
4:04:03
not even sure what our minds are either what view did he take of personal
4:04:08
identity what did he see people as being well the
4:04:14
discussion of personal identity is one of the most original and interesting parts of the essay
4:04:22
he agreed with descartes that one knew that one was a thinking thing but one didn't
4:04:28
know what kind of thing one is
4:04:33
in the 17th century the followers of cartesian modes of thought
4:04:39
thought that a very powerful argument for their view was that it explained immortality that
4:04:45
and personal identity that the identity of a person despite the flux of matter so it's big in the body the identity of
4:04:52
the person is determined in life by the identity of the soul and this soul could go on after to the
4:04:59
afterlife i mean and that would constitute our identity then now lock started from
4:05:05
uh a different consideration which is that immortality has to be personal
4:05:12
immortality the whole point of immortality is um well to put it bluntly reward and
4:05:18
punishment uh with a certain emphasis on punishment very often but the uh
4:05:24
unless the thing that was being punished in the afterlife was conscious
4:05:30
of the deeds that it had done in the in the light in in life on earth
4:05:36
then somehow locke thought that punishment lost its whole point so yes it might be as if a quite
4:05:41
different person were being punished right so he argued that i mean suppose we grant there is such a thing
4:05:47
as an immortal immaterial soul and suppose we grant that this um
4:05:53
receives punishment if that thing has no recollection of what
4:05:58
happened on earth the whole notion of immortality loses
4:06:03
its point so what really matters log said is not the this supposed immaterial soul but uh
4:06:12
consciousness but the consciousness of the individual uh
4:06:18
the continuity of consciousness the consciousness of the individual of its past of his past deeds and of course in
4:06:25
this life what matters is um the thought that it's going to be us who's going to get punished in the in
4:06:31
the world to come in my introduction to this program i refer to the enormous impact that locks political
4:06:39
philosophy made both in the period that lot lived in and in fact ever since it's always continued to
4:06:45
have an influence so i don't want us to get offlock and on to barclay before we say something about that one one thing
4:06:52
that i admire in fact i think the thing i admire most in locke's political philosophy is is the clarion call for
4:06:59
tolerance and at least one of his arguments for that is based on his insistence that after all we don't
4:07:06
really know all that much in this life we are wrong about a lot of things a great deal is mysterious to us and
4:07:13
therefore we are not justified in imposing our opinions on others by force
4:07:19
he has a very moving expression of that argument at one point which i like very much i must say
4:07:25
yes i think that is an important
4:07:30
connection with his
4:07:35
views on politics and religious tolerance in particular um
4:07:40
he has what you might call an individualistic view of knowledge that nobody else can do my knowing for me i
4:07:48
mean i have to think things out for myself in order to have knowledge
4:07:54
other people can pass on opinions now in certain areas in
4:08:01
ethics and and religion he thought that people
4:08:06
ought to spend time and ought to be given the time to spend on thinking things out for themselves as
4:08:12
far as possible and if you have that coupled with a very
4:08:18
strong sense of how difficult this is and how hard it is to get things right
4:08:23
then you've obviously got the recipe for a tolerant society we take it for granted but of course in his day it was very far from
4:08:30
being taken for granted what before we do move on i'd like you to sum up in
4:08:36
some way what you see uh lock's lasting contribution to philosophy or that's too big a question
4:08:42
what you see his most important contribution to philosophy as having been
4:08:48
well historically um of course something that you hinted at before that
4:08:53
he supplied a framework within which people could make sense of things like
4:08:58
newtonian science and so forth and a a way a way of looking at the world in
4:09:06
which we recognize that there's a lot about the world we don't understand and we
4:09:11
recognize the speculative nature of science and so forth and that was very important
4:09:19
he had another effect which was that some of his arguments for example his emphasis on the
4:09:25
on the point that what the knowledge we get through the senses is really just knowledge of
4:09:31
things with powers to act on us we don't really understand what lies behind those powers those arguments were employed by
4:09:37
philosophers like barkley himself who who were really aiming at quite a different kind of view
4:09:44
of the world or philosophy from logs but were able to make use of
4:09:49
what to them were concessions concessions to um [Music]
4:09:54
idealism all to skepticism i'm into a different quite a different sort of philosophy now i think that locke has a
4:09:59
lot still to say to us partly just because he was so to speak the last
4:10:05
great realist before the trend the tendency towards uh
4:10:12
idealistic idealist philosophy and and we can i think there's something deeply wrong
4:10:17
with idealist philosophy myself and i think that well it's very valuable to go back to locke
4:10:22
as a sort of pre-idealist realist and some in some ways to see what went wrong
4:10:28
but also to see to pick up um points which we've forgotten which we've lost i have much
4:10:35
more sympathy with idealism than you have but let that appear as it may let's now move on to the first of the
4:10:41
absolutely major idealists namely barclay and in a way we've prepared the ground for the step we're now taking
4:10:48
haven't we because the philosophical doctrine that berkeley is most famous for
4:10:53
is his rejection of the notion of material substance he just said there is no such thing
4:11:00
all we have is experience and we have no warrant for
4:11:05
inferring the existence of anything that isn't experienced now can you i mean that was partly a
4:11:12
reaction against locke can you does it start the discussion of his philosophy from that point well the way
4:11:19
you put it you make barclay look like a skeptic and he was i mean he hotly contended that his
4:11:24
philosophy was anti-skeptical i mean that he wasn't doubting that there was something out there in a
4:11:30
sense but what's out there is not the material world he he wanted um
4:11:35
the world basically to consist of um spirits
4:11:41
with he thought the whole of reality was spiritual well the sensible world is given a very subordinate role i mean he
4:11:48
doesn't deny its existence he says but he wants it to be in some way dependent on spirits i mean there's god and there
4:11:53
are finite spirits his motive is fundamentally theological uh to his mind the uh philosophers like
4:12:01
locke and uh descartes had turned the world into a kind of
4:12:07
god almost the turn the the material world because mata is something which
4:12:16
has a nature of its own which doesn't need god anymore in some way once god has created matter
4:12:23
it's like a great clock it can go ticking on and uh while god goes on holiday and this for berkeley was uh
4:12:32
sort of atheistic doctrine virtually i mean a lot of philosophers had thought that that
4:12:38
materialism was was a source of atheism and had attacked uh any view which gave
4:12:45
mata an it's equal status to spirit i mean a group called the cambridge
4:12:50
patronists or the cartesians themselves were like this had this view but berkeley was perhaps well one of the
4:12:56
first to have the idea of turning the tables on matter in a way by
4:13:03
making the sensible world nothing but such a big something which is
4:13:09
mind-dependent so that locks distinction between the world as it appears to us and the world
4:13:15
as it is in itself you see lot barkley just chops off the world as
4:13:21
it is in itself and all that's left is the world as it appears to us and he contends that he's not denying the
4:13:29
existence of anything in this way at least not the existence of anything that uh that counts or matters but how does
4:13:35
barkley if barclay thinks that there is no world as it is in itself that everything is of the nature of spirits
4:13:42
or ideas or experience uh how does he how does he account for
4:13:47
the success of modern science i mean how can there be a science if there's no matter he thought in a way he
4:13:54
could account for it better than lock could because whereas locke was left with this worry about things like the
4:14:00
inverse square law being just sort of brute fact um for barclay
4:14:05
all laws are just brute facts and they are in fact they represent the order in which god
4:14:13
affects us with uh ideas and uh the sequence of ideas is is what
4:14:21
constitutes uh the law the laws of nature and he had his own story explanation of of this
4:14:27
sequence this is his analogy is with language god is so to be
4:14:33
informing us of what is to come in a way so that if i see a fire
4:14:39
then i know that if i stretch out my hand i'll get burned and this is useful knowledge and
4:14:45
unless the ideas which god um uh instills in us were
4:14:53
um uh uh unless they were they were they were in this sort of order then
4:15:01
they would be useless to us i mean so he has this uh it's a sort of um
4:15:06
in fact he constructs an argument for god's existence out of all this of course in fact so one could sum up
4:15:11
barclay's view of total reality like this there's an infinite spirit which is god
4:15:17
there's a whole number of finite spirits which is us and we are somehow in communication with
4:15:23
god via our experience that yes what we take to be our whole experience of the
4:15:28
world is in this rather poetic metaphor god's language to us god is talking to
4:15:34
us yes and science all the regularities in the world all the scientific laws all the
4:15:40
equations of mathematics that are built into our experience are so to speak the grammar and the
4:15:45
syntax of god's language they are the structure of the divine communication to
4:15:50
human mind there's no magnificent idea there's no need to postulate matter at
4:15:56
all it doesn't do any work if all reality is mental in barclay's view
4:16:03
uh how is it that i can't choose what i see i mean when i if i close my eyes and
4:16:08
open them again i can't choose to see charlie chaplin sitting on that sofa i can't choose to see nobody sitting on
4:16:14
the sofa there you are michael ayers now anyone else would say locke would say
4:16:19
common sense would say well yes that's because michael airs is there independently of being perceived yes
4:16:26
barclay can't say that at least he can't say that about all the other kinds of material object in the universe how does
4:16:31
he explain it in the end he he he comes out which with with a notion which i i
4:16:36
think was there in his earlier writing but is not expressed uh very clearly
4:16:41
that there is something that exists independently of you and that is an idea in god's mind
4:16:47
and there is at least an intention of god to
4:16:52
produce appropriate ideas in your mind when you open your eyes right so
4:16:59
the real object is really explained um in terms of the
4:17:04
both of the orderliness the order of your ideas and the um
4:17:10
what exists in god's mind as the basis of that order but what is really important to berkeley you see is
4:17:17
not um the leap from your idea to something else for example an idea in god's mind
4:17:24
some people think that that leap has made berkeley just as vulnerable
4:17:30
as the materialist ever was to the skeptical argument but the important thing
4:17:35
for berkeley is that what he postulates is something mind
4:17:41
dependent and it's also he claims more intelligible because it's totally unintelligible as lock admitted
4:17:49
to us as to how mata should act on mind but he doesn't have that problem because god's
4:17:56
activity is something which is fundamentally intelligible in fact it's the only kind of genuine causality there
4:18:02
is in the universe is the activity of a spirit whether ourselves or god for
4:18:07
berkeley i think there's much more to be said for berkeley than we're making it sound i mean this insistence that
4:18:15
all that the objects of our knowledge can possibly ever be is the data of experience and experience alone
4:18:22
came long after barclay's death to be one of the orthodoxies of science and in fact karl popper has written a
4:18:29
famous article called a note on berkeley as a precursor of mark and einstein in
4:18:35
which he extracts 21 theses from barclay's work which he then shows have
4:18:40
been put forward by phys modern physicists like einstein under the impression that they were saying
4:18:45
something new and revolutionary i think there is a lot more to be said for
4:18:51
barclay than uh one can easily be inclined to allow
4:18:56
well it's it's perfectly true that um there is a powerful argument
4:19:04
for the view that our concept of anything must
4:19:10
in the end come back to our experience of that sort of thing however indirect
4:19:16
and uh and that argument has been uh very powerful now
4:19:22
of course this in a way is lock's argument too but locke
4:19:27
wants to say that doesn't mean to say that there isn't something with its own independent nature out there
4:19:34
and berkeley just wanted to sort of chop that off and and deny that i mean for berkeley
4:19:40
the world is not a mysterious place he's a dogmatic philosopher
4:19:45
it's uh for us rather in his terms a rather surprising place because there's no
4:19:51
no material world in the sense in which most people think of it
4:19:58
but it's not a mysterious place for berkeley whereas for locke you see he's prepared to accept that there is
4:20:03
something mysterious there thank you very much mr ayers
4:20:08
the philosopher most widely regarded as the greatest who has ever written in the english language is david hume not an
John Passmore on Hume
4:20:15
englishman but a scot born in edinburgh in the year 1711. he did some of his best work very young
4:20:22
at about 18 he experienced a sort of intellectual revelation and over the next eight years he
4:20:28
produced a large and revolutionary book called a treatise of human nature it met
4:20:33
with little attention and even less understanding in his own phrase it fell dead born from the press
4:20:40
so in his thirties he tried to rewrite that book in what he hoped would be a more popular form
4:20:45
this resulted in two smaller volumes one called an inquiry concerning human understanding and one called an inquiry
4:20:53
concerning the principles of morals but these were scarcely any better received and he gave the impression then
4:20:59
of turning away from philosophy in his forties he wrote a history of great britain which for a hundred years was
4:21:06
the standard work that's why he still sometimes categorized in libraries and books of reference as david hume
4:21:13
historian in his own lifetime he made his reputation too as an economist and his
4:21:19
monetary theories have been reattracting attention recently he was even in a modest way a man of affairs in the war
4:21:26
of the austrian succession he served as a staff officer on two military expeditions and for a couple of years in
4:21:33
his early fifties he was secretary to the british embassy in paris and then after that under secretary of state in
4:21:39
london in all the many different circles in which he moved he was popular for his
4:21:44
good nature as much as for his genius such was his gift for friendship that he
4:21:50
almost brought off the impossible task of befriending his french contemporary philosopher rousseau who at one time
4:21:57
actually proposed making his home in britain because hume was there in france hume was known as le bon david
4:22:05
and in his native edinburgh the street in which he lived was and is named after him saint david street
4:22:12
in view of the latter point it's perhaps ironical that in secret he'd been writing his final philosophical
4:22:18
masterpiece a profound and damaging critique of natural religion which didn't come to light until after his
4:22:25
death he died in 1776 and in 1779 his
4:22:30
dialogues concerning natural religion were published some people consider it his best work
4:22:36
he's an unusually attractive figure who should also be seen as part of that great flowering of intellectual life in
4:22:43
edinburgh in the 18th century which we now refer to as the scottish enlightenment in david hume adam smith
4:22:51
and james boswell the scottish enlightenment produced the english language's foremost philosopher
4:22:56
economist and biographer and they all knew each other adam smith was one of
4:23:01
hume's closest friends and was greatly influenced by him boswell contemplated writing hume's
4:23:07
biography though alas he never did there's no substantial literature on
4:23:13
hume and one of the best books in it hume's intentions was written by the person who is with me now to discuss his
4:23:20
work professor john passmore of the australian national university in canberra
4:23:26
professor passmore whenever hume uh gave a shorter exposition of his own philosophy which he in fact two or three
4:23:33
times did he always put fundamental emphasis on what he had to say about
4:23:38
causality that is to say what it is for one state of affairs to bring about or
4:23:44
cause another state of affairs the idea being that causality this cause and
4:23:49
effect relationship is what binds together the whole of our known world
4:23:54
and he thought that what he had to say about that was the cornerstone of his philosophy and in fact it would be true
4:24:01
to say that he it's what he's best known for today can you tell us what the nub of his argument on that was
4:24:08
i think i'll try to by means of a practical example suppose a small child whose parents
4:24:16
have always given it soft cotton toys just had soft cotton dolls soft cotton
4:24:22
dogs so on and so on everything's soft cotton one day somebody gives it a
4:24:27
rubber ball the child drops the rubber ball over the side of the bed
4:24:33
and the next thing he notices is the rubber ball bounces
4:24:38
nothing else in his experience has ever bounced before and here's this ball that begins bouncing
4:24:43
now the first thing that david hume says is it didn't matter how long the child had looked at that ball turning it over
4:24:50
looking at one side and another it could never have inferred that when it dropped
4:24:56
the ball the ball would bounce this came to it as something it couldn't expect
4:25:01
prior to experience now take an adult who's watching what happens at this point
4:25:08
the adult will say well what has happened is the child has
4:25:13
caused the ball to bounce by dropping it it would say the ball has a power
4:25:20
which makes it possible for it to bounce it might say there's a necessary connection between dropping this rubber
4:25:27
ball and it's bouncing that is how the adult would talk now hume comes along he says well what
4:25:34
does the adult got which the child doesn't have after all
4:25:39
all that has really happened is that on a number of occasions the adult has seen a ball drop
4:25:47
and seen it bounce in fact it has found this always happens is what he calls a constant conjunction so you have two
4:25:53
things you first of all have somebody dropping a ball or doing something of that kind and then you have bouncing but
4:25:59
suppose you'd seen this a hundred times instead of like the child only once
4:26:05
what difference can this make after all it hasn't now seen something it hadn't seen before it hasn't seen a mysterious power in the
4:26:11
ball it hasn't discovered a mysterious entity called a necessary connection and
4:26:17
some sort of peculiar property all it is seen is various people dropping balls
4:26:22
and the balls bouncing and yet in fact the adult does believe that there's a
4:26:27
necessary connection between the dropping of the ball and it's bouncing or where's this idea come from
4:26:33
because for hum all ideas have to come from somewhere and he says it comes from nothing
4:26:39
except the constant experience of this constant conjunction this works
4:26:45
upon the mind as he says it forms the habit in us of expecting a ball to
4:26:51
bounce when we drop it but nothing more is involved than that i could put what you've just said to us
4:26:57
in so to speak abstract general terms i think by expressing it this way that we can't form any conception at all of an
4:27:04
ordered world without the idea of causal connection between things
4:27:10
but cause we discover when we try is something that we can't actually observe
4:27:16
we may say that event a causes event b but we find when we examine the
4:27:22
situation that all we actually observe is event a followed by event b and there
4:27:28
isn't some third entity in the situation a causal link between them that we
4:27:33
observe and it won't do to say that ah well yes but we know that event a is the cause of
4:27:39
event b because b always and invariably follows a because the fact is for example that day
4:27:45
always and invariably follows night and night always and invariably follows day but neither is the cause of the other
4:27:53
so we have this indispensable notion of cause which is at the very heart of our conception of
4:27:59
the world and of our understanding of our own experience and yet this notion is not validated by experience or
4:28:06
observation and it can't be validated by logic either and by making us aware of that uh hume
4:28:15
it seems to me has put his finger on a problem to which there's still no generally
4:28:20
agreed solution would you agree to that yes there is people of course try various things most of which hume
4:28:27
discusses in the treatise and gets rid of some will say oh well nature is uniform so if a ball bounces once it
4:28:33
will go on bouncing but that's only to say that the same cause produces the same effect
4:28:39
always and that's exactly the thing which has to be demonstrated he's begging the question they're begging the question by saying that and this is true
4:28:46
if he says oh well at least it's now more probable that the ball will bounce than not but all probabilities hume says
4:28:53
are really based on our experience of connections so that this again is no real way out of
4:28:59
the of the problem he used the same form of argument with another very fundamental question didn't
4:29:05
he and that is the question of the self and the continuity of the self he said that
4:29:12
although we take it for granted that we have selves and that we are continuous selves
4:29:17
we discover that we can't actually locate this self in observation or experience that when we look inside
4:29:25
ourselves what we actually see is individual thoughts feelings memories emotions and
4:29:32
so on but we don't observe some other entity a self that has them now this is
4:29:38
a very disconcerting and startling doctrine isn't it what were its implications
4:29:45
i think one should add that hume was never really quite satisfied with this as you said he kept on going back when
4:29:52
he's giving an account of his theory to the doctrine of course allergy because there he felt satisfied he'd done what
4:29:57
he set out to do he'd shown that there is something about our character as human beings which
4:30:04
compels us to believe that things are necessarily connected with one another even although we don't observe in the
4:30:10
world that necessary connection but it gets terribly difficult when it comes to personal identity
4:30:16
he'd said earlier that in respect to ordinary identity what happens is something like this
4:30:21
actually every time we close our eyes something the thing in front of us disappears it's no longer there as a
4:30:27
perception but when we open our eyes again this is very rough and crude what
4:30:32
we see is so similar to what we saw before we close our eyes that we're confused we treat this as having been an
4:30:40
experience our identity because we because it's so like keeping our eyes open all the time and just having a
4:30:47
single perception now that's all right perhaps in respect to the identity of other people you
4:30:52
might say it's the same sort of thing we see them today and we see them tomorrow they're very like one another the
4:30:59
actions that they perform on one occasion have certain sorts of causal connections with the ones they
4:31:05
they have on other occasions but let's take ourselves
4:31:10
now we can't say that we become confused between this succession
4:31:16
of perceptions and a strict identity because this assumes that some we there
4:31:21
all the time to become confused and that's why hume says i think this is why hume says in the long run that he's very
4:31:28
dissatisfied with this and this really worried him because he'd begun from the assumption that so long as one talked
4:31:34
only about the human mind and human perceptions one wouldn't get into any great intellectual problems or any
4:31:40
intellectual confusions which couldn't be easily cleared away one thing that what he had to say about
4:31:46
cause and what he has to say about the self have in common is that in both cases he says
4:31:52
let's look for the actual observation the actual experience on which this everyday
4:31:58
idea is based and in each case when we look for them we discover to our amazement that they're not there
4:32:05
it's as if he's trying to base his philosophy on fact now is that what he was referring to in
4:32:11
the famous subtitle to his masterpiece the treatise i've actually written it down here he describes his treatise as
4:32:19
an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects
4:32:25
was he trying to make philosophy scientific was that his idea
4:32:31
well moral subjects of course he intended very broadly he would have included under that everything we now call politics
4:32:38
he would have included anything we would call psychology and as well as anything we would call moral
4:32:44
philosophy and he did want to make these more scientific in a
4:32:50
certain sense than they had ever been what he says is that when you approach these subjects you find that people who
4:32:56
usually talk seriously and take evidence into account start making wild statements
4:33:02
without any real evidence they start preaching at us rather than telling us what things are like they lay down laws
4:33:09
for us rather than looking at the facts and that we ought to look at the facts
4:33:14
in respect to political life and human affairs just as we
4:33:19
do in the natural sciences there's an implied theory of language
4:33:25
and meaning isn't there in in this approach that we are now talking about because
4:33:30
he very definitely thought that in order to for a word to mean anything at all it
4:33:35
had to relate to a specific idea and for an idea to have real content it had to
4:33:41
be derived from experience so in effect hume is saying if you want to know what a word means
4:33:47
look for the experience from which it's derived if you can't find an experience or an observation from which it derives
4:33:54
then it doesn't mean anything that that so there's this whole theory of meaning is there not underlying
4:34:01
the philosophical approach that you've just been outlining yes he draws distinction he's very keen on this
4:34:06
although he doesn't mention it specifically very often between talking and thinking
4:34:13
we're thinking only when we're operating with clear ideas which have a real
4:34:18
source in experience but he suggests that much of the time we're talking away and we're using what
4:34:25
are really completely confused nations which have no real foundation and experience if he looked at our
4:34:31
contemporary political life and our contemporary talk he'd find i think that it was full of nations which people use
4:34:38
completely reflectively if you ask what the foundation and experience was of let's say ideas like
4:34:45
social justice or ideas like accountability you might find it extremely difficult to
4:34:50
see what the actual factual situation was that these were referring to concretely what they concretely mean
4:34:57
and one of his main points is we should look and see what things concretely mean you'd be absolutely horrified by much of
4:35:04
what now passes for literary criticism for example that was something he was very interested in but he thought he had
4:35:09
to relate it very concretely to literature and now it becomes so much
4:35:14
of a rather bad philosophy full of expressions which hume i think would very rapidly show have no meaning
4:35:21
on his theory of meaning it led him to develop something that came subsequently to be known as hume's fork
4:35:27
he said of any given body of ideas that when you're approaching it for the first time you must ask yourself two main
4:35:33
questions do these ideas concern matters of fact
4:35:38
in which case do they rest on observation and experience or do they concern the relations between ideas as
4:35:45
in mathematics and logic if the answer to both those main questions is no then
4:35:51
he says commit those writings to the flames because they can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion he was a
4:35:58
great as you've just said clearer away of intellectual rubbish
4:36:04
not only in philosophy and politics but in religion and all sorts of other fields do you think that in the history
4:36:11
of philosophy that's one of his most important functions so to speak that he was a
4:36:16
clearer away of illusions i'm pretty sure about that the other thing was that
4:36:22
there's one particular illusion he's constantly clearing away and that is that we can prove
4:36:28
a great many things which we daily believe he's constantly showing that really we cannot
4:36:34
demonstrate even such facts as that things exist externally to us or they continue to
4:36:40
exist when we're not looking at them or again that some things are necessarily connected
4:36:46
with other things and this means that he often sounds extremely skeptical and indeed he
4:36:52
sometimes does express himself in a very skeptical way but he thinks
4:36:58
that it's impossible for any human being to be an all and all out skeptic inevitably you you have to believe you
4:37:05
have to act like any other human being and a certain measure of skepticism what he calls mitigated skepticism is very
4:37:12
useful because it prevents you from falling into the trap of large
4:37:18
ideologies large ideas of every thought which have no real foundation and experience you will say to yourself well
4:37:24
look i'm not really totally able to demonstrate the sun will rise tomorrow perhaps it won't
4:37:31
and why should anybody that's in that position think that they can say something about the total existence of
4:37:38
the world or some very elaborate concept of this kind
4:37:43
wouldn't it be true to say that his skepticism was not actually about the world but about the capacities of human
4:37:49
reason i mean i don't doubt for one moment that hume just genuinely did believe that
4:37:55
there is an independently existing world of material objects in space and time
4:38:00
that causally interrelate to each other and that we have representations of these through our senses and that these
4:38:07
representations are internal to us but give us an act an accurate picture of
4:38:12
the world around us all that the whole common sense view of the world i'm sure
4:38:17
hume believed but it seems to me that what he was contending was that none of this could be proved
4:38:24
you couldn't actually show you couldn't prove that any of this was so and you had to just kind of take it for granted
4:38:31
in ordinary living but i don't think he doubted it did he i don't think so after all it's essential to what he's saying
4:38:38
about the possibility of constructing a theory of human nature and he's able to say two things that this that this will
4:38:44
rest on one is our awareness of ourselves and the other is
4:38:50
our awareness about the human beings our experience of other human beings well this does imply that human beings exist
4:38:56
independently of us that we're not the only being on earth just living in a world of his own perceptions there are
4:39:02
other human beings they behave in various ways their behavior has particular effects and so on none of
4:39:08
this does he doubt i think in the most serious sense of doubting indeed you'd
4:39:13
have to be a madman to do so but he's showing that reason can't prove it but he's showing that what we can
4:39:20
prove is very much less than people believe even in the most fundamental affairs of life so that strict proof
4:39:27
plays a very small part in human life outside special areas like mathematics
4:39:32
and he didn't even think that was all that important in human affairs did he well he really felt that the important
4:39:38
things were well he says politics morals literary criticism and what he calls
4:39:43
logic which is his word he uses rather broadly to mean the theory of the human understanding anything else the sort of
4:39:49
thing that physicists talk about let's say was no doubt important but at the second order that
4:39:55
to get a clear understanding of human beings and of the human understanding
4:40:01
was indeed a necessary preliminary even to a soundly based physical science let alone to a soundly based human science
4:40:08
and i think he was a person to whom what mattered essentially were human beings
4:40:14
now lots of philosophers haven't been like this they've rather got rid of human beings they're individual human beings that's human concerned with
4:40:21
abstractions like abstractions and time and space and hume talks about these to some degree but
4:40:26
basically the human being lies at the center of his interests and in the old phrase he counts nothing human alien to
4:40:32
him what that brings out is that in that famous subtitle to his great work which
4:40:37
i read earlier an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning to moral subjects it's not only the phrase
4:40:45
the experimental method of reasoning that's important which everyone has always concentrated on but the phrase
4:40:51
moral subjects he was applying it to everything that directly concerns human beings
4:40:58
in my introduction to our discussion professor passmore when i referred to hume moving on from writing philosophy
4:41:05
to writing history i deliberately used the phrase he appeared to turn away from
4:41:10
philosophy i didn't actually say he did because i know that you in your book about hume have argued that in fact in
4:41:17
his mind this was not a turning away at all but a continuation of the same concerns
4:41:23
and i'd like you to expand that a little bit well i think in the first place of course the use of the word philosophy
4:41:29
in its very narrow modern sense is uh well as i just said very narrow very
4:41:35
modern philosophy had a much broader sense when hume wrote and even later indeed in cambridge much later physics
4:41:42
was called natural philosophy and subjects like economics and politics were included in moral philosophy and
4:41:48
that's the very broad sense of philosophy that hume is working with but i think there's another thing he wrote
4:41:53
these works the treatise especially he said as a necessary preliminary
4:41:59
to working on the subjects he took to be important morals and politics an essential preliminary
4:42:06
nobody paid any real attention to them he tried to present them in a different
4:42:11
form as you pointed out in your introduction in the inquiries people did still didn't pay any real attention to
4:42:17
them and it would have been absurd for him to go on working at these he had no real criticism of them he was quite convinced
4:42:23
he was right and in terms of his own views about things it was perfectly proper for him then to go on writing
4:42:30
essays on politics writing history writing about economics writing about
4:42:35
the population of the ancient world and discussing all these broad issues literary criticism again which it always
4:42:42
regarded as central it would have been idiotic for him to have continued all his life with what he regarded as being
4:42:49
only preliminary to these centrally important inquiries because all of it
4:42:54
was in his eyes what one might roughly call social philosophy wasn't it in some
4:42:59
form in a very broad sense it's what we would now call social philosophy but the first part one might very crudely call hume's
4:43:07
methodology of the social sciences it ran beyond that but it's as if a social
4:43:12
scientist were to spend all his life talking about his methodology and never actually doing any social science and
4:43:17
jim would have felt the same way if he'd spent all his life talking about his methodology and he says it's all the logic that's really needed is in the
4:43:24
traitors and not gone on to do the actual work that he thinks was of the greatest consequence now underlying this
4:43:30
very broad concern with human affairs there was a theory of human or a conception anyway
4:43:36
of human nature and you referred to that actually a few minutes ago in our discussion can you now bring out what
4:43:42
that conception of human nature was well it's a long story because really
4:43:47
most of his subsequent work is a study of human nature in action in practice
4:43:54
but one thing he never doubted was that there was such thing as human nature and this is a point at which he differed
4:44:00
from lock lock had been particularly intent on getting rid of the conception of original sin this was fundamentally
4:44:06
important to him because he was a religious thinker as well as a as well as a philosopher and he had argued that
4:44:13
human beings are born into the world with minds which are like blank sheets of paper and then in his works on education for
4:44:20
example the suggestion was that you could turn human beings in any direction you want to and many of the later
4:44:26
thinkers of the french enlightenment and really running on even to to modern marxism have taken this same
4:44:32
sort of view that at least society is the thing that makes human beings what
4:44:38
they are now hume didn't think that he says that he thought this was a ridiculous view that human beings do
4:44:45
have angers fears all the rest of it
4:44:51
affections which are innate which are inborn in them and which are constant
4:44:56
throughout human history human in different societies they may take different forms and some of them may be
4:45:02
strengthened and some weakened but there is a permanent human nature there in which the passions are central it's
4:45:09
striking i think in most of the thinkers of this period that they put an emphasis on passions and interests
4:45:16
in a way in which many subsequent philosophers have not there are of course important exceptions to that
4:45:22
part of the basis for what he had to say about human nature being always the same was his deep learning in the classical
4:45:30
languages wasn't it he he was deeply and widely read in greek and latin literature
4:45:36
and history and what struck him one of the things that struck him about uh those times was that human behavior
4:45:44
in very considerable detail had been just the same 2000 years before the time
4:45:49
he was reading then he saw it around here as he saw it around him in his own time
4:45:54
yes he was particularly interested in writers like cicero and in what cicero said about human nature and human beings
4:46:00
and human society and he felt it wasn't so different from 18th century england and that human beings were still
4:46:06
behaving in much the same kind of way it was the latin writers rather than the greek writers who particularly
4:46:12
influenced him at that level he constantly equates cicero so that was some of the evidence that he would have
4:46:18
given for there being a permanent human nature but also when he writes about let's say the natural
4:46:24
history of religion it's again on the assumption that human beings have been much the same who've been faced by the
4:46:31
same threats the same anxieties it had much the same ideals throughout history
4:46:36
even in much earlier societies than the greek and roman society it's not only an assumption is it i mean he tries to
4:46:42
demonstrate this with a great deal of factual example he tries to demonstrate by a factual example but it is all the
4:46:47
same i think uh to some measure something that he thinks you can't seriously question although as i say
4:46:53
many subsequent writers and locked before him have seriously questioned them when one looks at hume from the
4:46:58
standpoint of our time i think one is very struck by the sort of modernity from our point of view of very much of
4:47:05
it i mean he was centrally concerned with this problem of the self well some of the best philosophy that's been done in
4:47:11
britain in recent years has been about problems of the self scientists in the 20th century have been
4:47:18
deeply puzzled especially in their thinking about quantum physics about the presence or absence of causal
4:47:26
connection and only yesterday so to speak the logical positivists or at least the
4:47:31
chief representative of logical positivism in the english-speaking world aj air were constantly talking about how
4:47:38
much they owed to hume and how almost everything they'd air is constantly saying that almost everything he has to
4:47:44
say has previously been said by hume one comes up against this modernity to us
4:47:50
again and again and one of the 20th century problems of philosophy that
4:47:55
he is credited with having formulated for the first time is the famous problem
4:48:01
of induction isn't it that is to say that the the logical basis on which
4:48:06
scientific theories were traditionally said to rest can you tell us a little about that well it's
4:48:13
very closely related to what i said previously about causality go back to my baby that's dropping this ball
4:48:20
out of it well i suppose it does this on monday and it does it on tuesday and it doesn't on wednesday and it doesn't on
4:48:25
thursday every time it drops the ball the ball bounces then certainly hume
4:48:30
would say it comes to believe that whenever it drops the ball the ball
4:48:36
will bounce it comes to expect the ball to bounce whenever it drops it but
4:48:41
suppose we ask why since all that has happened is the same thing has occurred on many occasions but we
4:48:48
all know quite well that things can occur on many occasions and then on some occasion
4:48:54
they don't occur anymore there's a change in the way things happen you've been accustomed to relying on these
4:49:01
regularities but the regularity breaks down now all hume is saying is we can
4:49:06
never be quite sure that this won't happen in respect to any
4:49:12
regularity whatsoever there's no way of arguing from the premises
4:49:18
that things have happened in a certain way on very many occasions in the past to the conclusion that they're bound to
4:49:25
happen in exactly the same way in the future and of course the point here is that
4:49:30
every scientific law is an unrestrictedly general statement which is said to rest on a number of
4:49:36
particular observations or experiments or instances and the logical link can't be made
4:49:44
there's a marvelous example of this in in the history of philosophy itself in
4:49:49
logic books in some logic books in the middle ages one sentence that was used as an example was all swans are white
4:49:56
and of course for literally thousands of years every swan that any western man had ever seen was white
4:50:02
and there must have been millions of instances of white swans and not a single counter-example but in the 18th
4:50:09
century when western man discovered your country australia
4:50:14
for the first time europeans saw black swans and it's a marvelous illustration
4:50:19
of the fact that however many thousands or millions of times a particular thing has been observed and found to be so and
4:50:26
so it does not follow from that that the next one will be and therefore this is
4:50:32
the logically important point no finite number of specific observations can
4:50:37
never logically entail an unrestrictedly general or universal conclusion but all scientific laws are
4:50:45
of that character and therefore they are not logically entailed by the observations that are supposed to be
4:50:51
their bases and this is an explosive insight isn't it i mean it seemed to people to knock away the foundations
4:50:59
of science as they understood it yes i think it's more and more widely agreed by scientists themselves
4:51:05
that scientific propositions are in some measure hypothetical and
4:51:10
many very firmly based ones have been overthrown in the past people used to say that einstein didn't overthrow
4:51:17
newton he simply produced a more general theory of which newton's theory is part but that's not
4:51:24
really true there are some things that newton said and it had now been shown to be false and newton was for a long time
4:51:31
the supreme example of a kind of certain demonstrative sign bertrand russell in
4:51:37
his famous book a history of western philosophy after he's said something about hume's
4:51:42
doctrines on these various fundamental things that we've considered uh the cause and effect relationship the nature
4:51:50
of the self the inductive basis for scientific laws russell then goes on to say that in many
4:51:56
of these respects we still haven't got beyond hume that he pointed out very
4:52:03
fundamental problems that no one has yet solved this is true of course equally true that plato pointed out very
4:52:09
fundamental questions that nobody has yet solved it's unfortunate it's much easier in in philosophy to
4:52:16
ask questions and to raise difficulties than to produce solutions but i think one crucial thing about hume
4:52:23
is the questions he asked and i think that's also true of plato were very fundamental ones so that we can say that
4:52:29
if a person doesn't take hume's question seriously he can't really be counted as
4:52:35
a philosopher yes these are absolutely fundamental to what philosophy is aren't they yes they are fundamentalist they're
4:52:41
not the only issues which are fundamental but they are fundamental issues what sort of a man was he i get the
4:52:48
impression when i read his work and i've been rereading it for this discussion just recently
4:52:54
i get the impression of a kind of massive humaneness which is enormously attractive
4:53:00
yes i you know his friend adam smith said he came as near to perfection in these sort of respects as any human
4:53:05
being possibly could and biographers have explored his life in great detail i
4:53:10
don't think any of them have found a single example of a mean or a malicious
4:53:15
action he's occasionally a bit timid well not unnaturally he had views about religion
4:53:21
which were scarcely popular in the society in which he was living he's occasionally a little bit vain but this is a form i
4:53:28
have seen if it is that which i can easily forgive but he doesn't ever
4:53:34
act meanly or maliciously and i'm quite sure that if there was a sort of celestial
4:53:40
philosopher's party a dinner party it's david schumer would want to sit next to
4:53:46
i think in many ways plato was the greater philosopher but it's david hume i would want to sit next to and i think
4:53:51
almost everybody else would he had this warm humanity he was without pretensions
4:53:58
he was a man of very considerable personal courage he was dying of cancer in his last years
4:54:04
he still received his friends as usual he knew or believed he knew that he was
4:54:09
certainly not immortal but this didn't disturb him in the least it very much disturbed boswell when boswell
4:54:15
interviewed him towards the end but he managed to retain that sort of equanimity and moderation and
4:54:21
cheerfulness which was his own ideal yes and his style has had great influence hasn't it
4:54:28
i mean i mentioned earlier in this discussion two 20th century british philosophers both of them famous aj air
4:54:35
and bertrand russell who have been consciously influenced by the hume way of doing things and they've been many
4:54:41
others yes well he did place this great emphasis on clarity and indeed on
4:54:47
elegance i recently heard clarity and elegance referred to as old-fashioned virtues which nobody
4:54:54
now attempts but certainly air and russell attempted them and certainly hume attempted them
4:55:01
and he said a certain pattern of british philosophizing in which one tries to be clear one tries to be
4:55:08
critical one tries not to make large assumptions one tries to look all the while at what
4:55:13
one's doing in a critical spirit and one tries to tie it up to what actually happens in the world
4:55:21
hume's approach does raise one important difficulty doesn't it you
4:55:26
refer to the fact that he stresses that most of the things that we take for granted we don't actually know and can't
4:55:33
prove can never prove uh that being so
4:55:38
how are we to distinguish between the sort of view that it's reasonable to hold and the sort of view that it's
4:55:45
unreasonable to hold what then becomes the criterion of
4:55:50
a reasonable man's belief this is a very difficult question at times hume
4:55:56
seems to be saying nothing more than that well in general it's much more sensible to rely on constant
4:56:02
conjunctions and on mere chance he gives rules for judging of cause and effect at
4:56:07
other times he seems to suggest there's really no answer to this question but that is something that i think would
4:56:13
satisfy nobody and one might say that is the principal problem that hume said i referred to it in a way a little while
4:56:19
ago we agree let us say that uh scientific
4:56:25
laws are not demonstrable in the strict sense why however is it still far better
4:56:33
to depend on these in our practical affairs of life than in some silly idea that someone
4:56:39
thinks up in a bestseller see i think that what hume had to say about all this is very germane to the ideas about
4:56:46
science that most people have today in the 20th century my impression
4:56:51
is that most people including most well-educated people have the idea of science that it
4:56:57
consists of a body of known demonstrated proved certainties and that the growth
4:57:03
of science consists in adding new certainties to the body of already existing ones
4:57:09
anybody who has that view of human knowledge or that view of science really has a very fundamental lesson to learn
4:57:16
from hume don't they i mean hume retains his full power to disconcert today
4:57:22
doesn't he yes hume is an extremely disconcerting thinker i think it's uh still true in respect to
4:57:29
science that science does make certain there's all sorts of things we know about the world we didn't know before scientists
4:57:35
got going but certainly when a lot of people for example think of science as something where there's no room for the
4:57:40
imagination at all they imagine you they believe that you have all sorts of need for the imagination if you're writing a
4:57:46
novel or writing a play but when you're doing science it's just a question of going into a laboratory and seeing what
4:57:52
happens now this is nonsense any kind of scientific work above the
4:57:58
most trivial is an enormous feat of the imagination if you take contemporary
4:58:03
cosmology for example it's well this is admittedly a a very extreme example but it's an
4:58:09
extraordinary imaginative feat and the same is true of things like dna genetics any of the great discoveries
4:58:16
require not merely careful work in laboratories though this is essential and careful thinking at all levels but
4:58:23
also a capacity to make imaginative leaps and it's interesting that in hume
4:58:29
the idea of the imagination constantly re-emerges as a being of central importance the imagination he thinks
4:58:36
is essential to all our thinking about the world even in what we call our perception of facts there is always an
4:58:43
element of the imagination at work and the centrality of the imagination is one
4:58:48
of the things i find most fascinating in david hume it's directly germane to what you've just said that the greatest of
4:58:54
all 20th century scientists einstein once said he said in 1928 i remember he
4:58:59
made the remark that he would never have dared to overthrow the science of newton
4:59:05
had he not read hume well i'd like to i'd like to finish our discussion really by asking you to say a
4:59:12
little more about the influence of hume or major thinkers subsequent to him
4:59:18
he did you've already referred to his influence on calm too i think most philosophers would regard as the
4:59:23
greatest of all philosophers since hume uh what was his influence on can't well i
4:59:29
think that can't unlike the british critics of hume really did see what jim was about he saw
4:59:37
he had to do philosophy in a quite different kind of way and if he was going as he wanted to do
4:59:43
to answer human particularly to get rid of what he took to be skeptical elements in hume
4:59:48
he had to say that really our perception of the world is of a
4:59:53
quite different kind from the sort of thing that humanity's predecessors have taken
4:59:58
it to be we don't as humor always presumes have isolated perceptions simply
5:00:05
following one another we are from the beginning aware of things
5:00:10
as being causally connected coarsely linked with one another one gets encounter over a great emphasis on the
5:00:16
creative power of the mind as well the suggestion of disorder is in part imposed by the mind and that leads in a
5:00:23
direction that you wouldn't have liked it leads in the direction of subsequent german idealism in the direction of
5:00:28
writers like hegel but kant did see didn't he that if you started with empiricist assumptions
5:00:35
hume then posed problems that on empiricist assumptions you couldn't answer that was his view and kant's
5:00:42
solution was to reject the assumptions and and start a whole new approach he
5:00:48
does see i think the essential thing that if you begin from the position
5:00:54
that what we're aware of are isolated events whether they're in our own mind where their perceptions are on the
5:01:00
surface of our skin or in the world you cannot create out of them simply as
5:01:05
your soul material the kind of ordered world which in fact we experience in our
5:01:11
daily life well to continue the discussion beyond this point would take us into a discussion of khan so i think
5:01:17
we'll stop there thank you very much indeed professor passmore good thank you
Geoffrey Warnock on Kant
5:01:24
for several generations now it's been a widely held view among serious students of philosophy that the greatest
5:01:30
philosopher to have appeared in the west since the ancient greeks is immanuel kant kant was born in the town of koenigsberg
5:01:37
in east prussia in 1724 and died there at an age of almost 80 in the year 18
5:01:42
for many jokes have been made about the fact that he rarely left koenigsberg and
5:01:48
never went outside his native province in the whole of his life also about the fact that he stuck so
5:01:53
strictly to a daily routine that the inhabitants of koenigsberg could literally set their watches by him as he
5:01:59
walked past their windows he never married and outwardly his life was entirely uneventful
5:02:06
however he was not at all the dry stick that my description so far would suggest on the contrary he was sociable and
5:02:12
amusing elegant in dress and witty in conversation and his lectures at the university of konigsberg where he was a
5:02:19
professor for more than 30 years were famous for their brilliance rather surprisingly kant was the first
5:02:26
great philosopher of the modern era to be a university teacher descartes spinoza leibniz locke barclay hume russo
5:02:35
none of these were academics nor were most of the major philosophers in the century after camp the 19th century the
5:02:42
obvious exception is hegel but schopenhauer kiragawh karl marx john stuart mill nietzsche none of these were
5:02:49
academic philosophers it's only in the 20th century that nearly all important philosophers have been academics whether
5:02:57
this professionalization of the subject is a good thing is very much a moot point i suspect it's inevitable
5:03:03
however to get back to the first of the great professors the writings of kant's youth and early middle age made him
5:03:09
widely known but all but a few of them are now virtually unread his lasting
5:03:14
fame rests on a series of publications which didn't begin till he was 57 and continued into his seventies so we have
5:03:22
the rare spectacle of a creative genius of the first order producing all his greatest work in late middle age and old
5:03:29
age his acknowledged masterpiece is the critique of pure reason which was
5:03:34
published in 1781 it wasn't very well understood at first so two years later he published a short
5:03:41
exposition of its central argument as a separate book usually referred to as the prologue
5:03:47
and then brought out an extensively revised edition of the critique of pure reason in 1787
5:03:53
there followed in quick succession his second great critique the critique of practical reason in 1788 and then his
5:04:01
third critique the critique of judgment in 1790 meanwhile he also published in 1785 a
5:04:08
little book called the fundamental principles of the metaphysics of ethics in spite of its unseductive title this
5:04:16
book has had a simply immense influence on model philosophy ever since
5:04:21
with me to discuss kant's work is a well-known contemporary philosopher sir jeffrey warnock principal of hartford
5:04:27
college oxford and a former vice chancellor of oxford university so jeffrey kant was perhaps the most
5:04:34
famous system builder in the contemporary era in philosophy and one notorious difficulty about expanding any
5:04:40
system where everything fits in with something else is where to break into it how to make a start where do you think
5:04:47
is the the best point to break into kant for an exposition of his philosophy there certainly is that problem i mean
5:04:54
one of kant's merits in a way was he was very good at making an immense range of views fit
5:05:00
together in a comprehensive and systematic way but
5:05:05
if we are embarking on the discussion i think it is important
5:05:11
not to start off in too technical a way i mean to he's sometimes represented as
5:05:17
conducting a sort of uh refereeing and job uh between the
5:05:23
merits and demerits of rationalism and empiricism for example or discussing how there can be synthetic
5:05:30
necessary truths but i think one ought to go rather further back to
5:05:36
what the much wider and simpler concern was that really generated these other
5:05:42
problems and that i would submit was his concern with an apparent
5:05:50
conflict between the findings of the physical sciences in his
5:05:56
day and our fundamental ethical and religious convictions he thought there
5:06:02
was a prima facie conflict inconsistency there can you spell out what he thought the conflict
5:06:08
consisted in um i think the central and simplest form of
5:06:14
the conflict was that it seemed to be a presupposition and indeed can't thought a well-funded
5:06:21
and proper presupposition of the physical sciences that everything that happens is
5:06:27
determined by antecedent happenings and that there is always a law
5:06:33
on the basis of which one can say that what happened was the only thing that could have happened
5:06:38
in the physical world in the physical world yes but of course when we're
5:06:44
thinking about our own conduct when we're thinking say about
5:06:50
moral predicaments we may find ourselves in we believe that we and everybody else
5:06:56
have alternatives before us and that there are various things we could do
5:07:01
and it's for that reason that we have to accept the responsibility for what we actually do
5:07:07
that was one thing and he thought that that was prima facie contradicted by a presupposition of physical science in
5:07:13
other words how in a universe in which the motions of all matter are governed by
5:07:18
newtonians there be scientific laws can there be free will yes yes yes he was also concerned with the
5:07:26
question uh how a god would fit in to an essentially mechanical and
5:07:33
physically determined universe he wasn't the first philosopher even the first major philosopher to see these
5:07:39
problems was he no no certainly not um they'd been
5:07:44
really quite a preoccupation of philosophers all through the 18th century i mean ever since the
5:07:50
um sort of great leap forward so to speak in the physical sciences at the end of the 17th century
5:07:56
um among the empiricists for example berkeley had been preoccupied with this sort of problem
5:08:03
and among those in khan's own tradition conspicuously leibniz no he certainly
5:08:08
wasn't first why was he so deeply dissatisfied as he obviously was with what his predecessors had done about
5:08:15
this problem well he thought and i think correctly that his
5:08:20
predecessors had tried to somehow
5:08:26
resolve this conflict or bring it to an end by downgrading the pretensions of the
5:08:32
physical sciences and that's certainly true of barclay and i think it's true of lightness as well
5:08:38
and to somehow present them as inferior
5:08:44
and not having a claim to be an equal contestant with uh metaphysical doctrine and
5:08:52
argument and for one thing i think kant thought that
5:08:57
the the record showed that that was not the right way to
5:09:02
proceed because on the one hand the physical sciences seem to proceed smoothly and progressively from triumph
5:09:09
to triumph with everybody agreeing what had been established and what hadn't um
5:09:15
and on the other hand philosophy looked to him like a sort of chaotic
5:09:21
battlefield i mean no philosopher agreed with any other philosopher no doctrine was accepted for more than a few years
5:09:28
before somebody refuted it and so on that's one thing
5:09:33
but then he also thought and i think this is more important that
5:09:39
hume in particular had raised serious doubts
5:09:44
about the credentials of philosophy
5:09:50
as a sort of possible intellectual enterprise at all and he thought that hume's hume's
5:09:57
challenge if one can call it that had raised a serious doubt as to whether what the philosophers were professing to
5:10:03
do was even in principle possible he made a famous remark once about reading hume having woken him from his
5:10:10
dogmatic slumber you take it to what you're now saying refers to this yes what was the awakening in fact
5:10:17
what did what did hume awaken him to the
5:10:23
problem i think in a crude nutshell was this that um
5:10:29
hume and indeed leibniz and such other philosophers had thought about it had
5:10:36
accepted the general view that propositions
5:10:42
can be exhaustively divided into two classes on the one hand
5:10:47
there are what used to be called truths of reason which can't called analytic propositions
5:10:54
where um in a sense they're really true by definition like a triangle has three
5:11:01
sides or a bicycle has two wheels that sort of thing those they said could be
5:11:06
known a priori i mean independently of experience
5:11:11
on the other hand there were substantial propositions which tell us something not simply implicit in the
5:11:18
terms we're using these they said
5:11:24
were substantial and informative but couldn't be necessary they were always
5:11:30
contingent propositions and could be established only on the basis of experience or experiment
5:11:37
and hume said and kant thought he was quite right to say that if that was right
5:11:45
then philosophy itself was in a serious predicament because it didn't put itself forward on
5:11:53
the one hand as an empirical science based on observation and experiment and
5:12:00
on the other hand it didn't want to say that all it was doing was elaborating a set of tautologies
5:12:07
analyzing the terms in which we speak and think and
5:12:12
hume's question was well is there anything else that a philosopher could possibly be doing if he isn't doing
5:12:18
either of those but didn't hume realize and can't after him that it also created
5:12:23
a serious problem for the natural sciences because scientific unrestrictedly
5:12:29
general scientific laws yes are also uh propositions that are neither
5:12:36
analytic they can't be deductively arrived at by logic nor can they be
5:12:41
proved from experience and they both realized that too didn't they
5:12:47
i'm i'm not sure it shouldn't be i think diversion at the moment to go into it uh
5:12:54
really what hume thought about that i think hume thought that the sciences
5:12:59
could sort of carry on as a body of empirical knowledge um though of course in that case without
5:13:06
the claim to establish that anything was necessarily so yeah um kant's view though was certainly that
5:13:15
um this belief in an exhaustive dichotomy
5:13:20
was mistaken he had no doubt that it was mistaken because
5:13:26
while one might question the credentials of philosophers in claiming
5:13:33
to put forward synthetic propositions that were both synthetic and necessary
5:13:38
that might be questionable kant had no doubt that this was perfectly in common form so to speak
5:13:46
in the natural sciences and in mathematics so that there certainly were he thought
5:13:52
undoubtedly there were propositions which were not analytic but were not
5:13:57
empirical and contingent either in other words propositions which applied to the world but yet we which we
5:14:04
didn't as it were derived from them yes but which we could establish simply by argument yes
5:14:10
and he called them synthetic a priorized technical term he used yes now uh if
5:14:16
such propositions apply to the world but are not so to speak read off from the world by experience by observation
5:14:24
how do we arrive at them well um yes
5:14:30
one has to introduce here i think one of kant's most important distinctions between
5:14:38
what he called things in themselves or the world as it is in itself and appearances
5:14:46
now on the question of things in themselves and kant would have said
5:14:52
we can't make any demands i mean things in themselves simply are as they are and
5:14:59
there's nothing we can do about that but if you move to the topic of the world as
5:15:07
we experience it as it presents itself to us as an object
5:15:13
of experience to the world what he called appearances
5:15:18
then he said it's a different matter because there are certain
5:15:25
conditions he claimed which any world
5:15:30
must satisfy if it is to be a possible object of experience at all for us
5:15:36
for well us and other people i think too um he thought it
5:15:41
um a crucial fact that the world is a common object of experience to an
5:15:48
indefinite array of subjects of experience and if there is to be such a world that
5:15:54
can be experienced and known about in common to a community of subjects of experience then he argued there are
5:16:02
conditions which it must satisfy and we can say a priori
5:16:07
that appearances must satisfy these conditions
5:16:13
would it be correct to put what you've just said in the following sort of way that what there is for us to experience or
5:16:20
perceive or know must of course depend on what there is to experience or perceive or know but it
5:16:27
must also depend on what apparatus we have for experiencing or seeing or no
5:16:33
yes and that the apparatus that we have is a contingent matter i mean to use a
5:16:38
modern example we we happen to be equipped to interpret uh electromagnetic
5:16:44
waves of some frequencies but not others that's to say we can receive and interpret uh heat waves and light rays
5:16:51
but we don't receive and interpret radio waves and x-rays yes and it's
5:16:56
imaginable that we might apprehend reality in entirely different terms from those that do yes
5:17:04
now kant is saying this being so
5:17:09
for us to be able to experience anything at all it must be such as is
5:17:16
apprehensible by our apparatus by the apparatus we've yes yes now that's not
5:17:23
to say that nothing else can exist but only that it can't so to speak exist for
5:17:28
us that that we can't know it or appreciate it is that right
5:17:33
well i would qualify that in one way i can't didn't i think want to get into
5:17:40
considerations about what our sensory equipment specifically
5:17:46
is i mean what kind of eyes and ears we have
5:17:51
i think he was trying to say something more general than that that the notion of a subject of experience
5:17:58
presented with a world as an object of experience requires that it should have
5:18:05
sensory uh capacities of some kind and intellectual and conceptual
5:18:12
capacities of some kind but he didn't want to say they must be of this specific kind all that
5:18:19
i mean he didn't he wouldn't have been interested in whether our eyes were different from those of
5:18:25
kestrels say i mean just that we must have some way of perceiving yeah but the
5:18:30
point then is that we bring certain as it were predispositions to bear and only what
5:18:36
fits into those predispositions can be experienced that's absolutely right yes
5:18:42
and this was something the nature of which i think had not occurred to any philosopher before genuinely novel i
5:18:48
think yes now what sort of entirely novel view of the nature of human
5:18:53
knowledge did this begin to lead him towards well he he put forward the claim
5:19:01
that if one um sort of thought carefully and often argued long enough
5:19:08
one could specify what he called the form of
5:19:14
any possible experience this he he gave the name this the
5:19:21
metaphysic of nature or sometimes the metaphysic of experience to this enterprise
5:19:28
what he called the matter that was a contingent matter and there might be this or that actually happening but he
5:19:34
thought one could spell out and think out what the form as
5:19:39
he called it of any possible experience must be and this would be a
5:19:46
body of doctrine that would tell you something about the world of course because it's telling you what its essential form is
5:19:53
but telling you something necessary that couldn't be otherwise and for this and because there are such
5:19:59
uh propositions that was why hume and others of his predecessors were wrong
5:20:05
in analyzing all possible propositions into either analytic which would be true
5:20:10
or false by nature of the terms used and synthetic uh or a posteriori which were
5:20:17
true or false according to observations yes we've now got a third kind yes yes
5:20:23
now can you give us an example or two of of concepts or propositions which
5:20:28
are of this sort well um putting it in the most general terms
5:20:35
they divide into two broad classes first of all can't try to deal with what
5:20:42
he called the form of sensibility or perception and he thought that here
5:20:49
one could spell out and work out the fundamental character of space and time
5:20:56
he thought these were imposed upon our experience by the nature of our sensibility
5:21:03
and i i want to stop you there because i think this is a very hard idea for people to grasp that's new yes he was saying that space
5:21:11
and time don't characterize things as they are in themselves yes indeed but
5:21:16
are inescapable modes of experience for us that's right that we can only
5:21:21
experience things in these dimensions but independently of our experience
5:21:26
these dimensions can't be said to exist that's certainly right and he would say
5:21:32
if somebody said well what about the creation as it is in itself
5:21:39
what kind of spatial and temporal order does it display count would say not a discussable topic and all we can talk
5:21:46
about is that world which is an object of experience to us
5:21:53
and the world as it appears and he thought that here
5:21:58
it's very arguable whether he was right to have this thought but he thought that
5:22:04
in thus bringing in space and time as forms of sensibility he was in effect
5:22:10
bringing in geometry and arithmetic amazingly rather odd claim but he thought that geometry and arithmetic
5:22:18
dealt with forms of sensibility and were bodies of synthetic a priori
5:22:23
truth for that reason given that he says that there are propositions of this special kind which apply to the world
5:22:30
but are not derived from experience yes could i decide could i just intermediate yes um i
5:22:36
um was going to say that his synthetic a priori proposition divide into two broad
5:22:41
classes and you've only dealt with one of them of course if i could just very briefly bring in the second right
5:22:47
um he thought that there are also what he called forms of the understanding
5:22:53
um sends forms of thought and i suppose the
5:23:00
fundamental principles which he tried to show were conditions of the possibility of understanding
5:23:08
would be first of all the principle of universal causal determinism which he thought was
5:23:13
one of them and then rather unplausibly he also tries to show
5:23:19
that newton's law of the conservation of matter states a condition of the possibility of
5:23:24
experience too now in order to arrive at the sort of total picture that we are beginning to build up
5:23:30
uh let me just uh recapitulate up to this point that kant is saying
5:23:35
that because all of our knowledge and experience comes to us through our sensory and mental apparatus
5:23:42
it all comes to us in forms which are sense dependent and mind-dependent yes
5:23:48
and that we have no direct access to things as they are in themselves independently of all possible experience
5:23:56
now given that the modes of apprehension that we have are whatever they are
5:24:02
uh possible experience must as it were fit in with them to be able to be
5:24:09
experienced for us at all absolutely and uh part of his project as a philosopher
5:24:15
therefore was to carry out a large-scale investigation into what the nature of
5:24:21
these forms was yes and if that investigation is
5:24:27
successful and complete it will tell us what the limits of all possible knowledge
5:24:33
is is that right yes yes and that anything that's outside that
5:24:38
is just simply unknowable to us yes yes
5:24:44
now the implications of this are absolutely radical not only for what is included but for what is left out up
5:24:51
there that's certainly true and fundamentally true and um
5:24:57
i find it hard to believe that it wasn't so to speak something of a disappointment to cut the time this is
5:25:04
the position he got himself into because one gets the impression from the way he embarks on his inquiries
5:25:11
that he would like to build a sort of firm foundation for theological speculation about god and
5:25:19
the soul and metaphysical speculation about the cosmos
5:25:25
whereas what he actually finishes up doing is saying that there can be no such foundations
5:25:32
because all we can establish foundations for is the notion of possible experience and
5:25:41
what can be an object of possible experience and if you try to go beyond that
5:25:47
if you try to raise questions about how the cosmos should be characterized
5:25:54
quite independently of any possible experience or if you try to talk about god and the
5:25:59
soul then your enterprise must collapse and be in
5:26:05
principle vacuous count is saying certainly now can't thought that it was impossible
5:26:11
for us to know whether god exists or not or whether we have souls or not but he did himself believe that god did exist
5:26:18
and that we do have souls didn't he yes he was very clear that this was a matter of faith and not something that was
5:26:25
knowable yes but how on his own premises is talk about god or the soul even
5:26:31
intelligible yes well that's a very good question and one
5:26:37
on which he is i can say slightly shifty i think
5:26:43
what he wants to say and this is rather interesting it involves him sort of
5:26:49
turning the whole issue upside down in a rather interesting way because
5:26:55
some of his predecessors at a rate had made the supposition that our
5:27:01
moral convictions and attitudes and our religious convictions
5:27:06
stand in need of some kind of metaphysical foundation and they tried to provide one in the form of theology
5:27:14
and philosophical ethics um well khan finishes up um putting the
5:27:20
thing exactly the other way up he says that we are not only entitled to moral
5:27:26
convictions and religious convictions he thought it inescapable that we should have them
5:27:33
but and these would lead us to essentially metaphysical doctrines about god and the
5:27:38
soul but that those doctrines themselves if they had any foundation at all
5:27:45
um it consisted directly in our primitive moral convictions themselves so that it's those that are fundamental
5:27:52
is he saying this that it just is an inescapable empirical fact that we're all directly familiar with yes but
5:27:59
whether we like it or not most of us at least simply do have moral convictions which we find ourselves unable to ignore
5:28:06
even when we want to yes and that's a fact now for these convictions to have any real
5:28:13
validity or significance at all the essential moral terms like good bad
5:28:19
right wrong okay blame etc for these to have any significance at all
5:28:24
there must be some freedom of choice it must be possible for some of us some of the time
5:28:31
to have done other than we did otherwise the terms are meaningless yes but how is that possible
5:28:37
uh on the one hand in a world in which all uh notions of matter are
5:28:44
governed by newtonian laws that was one problem that you started us off with right at the very beginning of the
5:28:50
discussion yes but also um for us to have free will which he thinks
5:28:57
is an inescapable consequence of the direct experience we do have of moral
5:29:04
categories then there must be some sort of moral realm
5:29:09
is that great yes yes now how does he get even further as it were from that to
5:29:16
god or i mean what he says about himself
5:29:21
thinking about theology and religion i think specifically he says that he had denied
5:29:28
knowledge in order to make room for faith he had simply
5:29:33
shown why it was that the sort of subject matter of theology if i
5:29:39
put it like that is not a possible topic of knowledge but then he says what's alarming about
5:29:45
that because we've all known all along that it's essentially a matter of faith
5:29:51
but as you rightly say and one could claim that his arguments have really
5:29:56
been rather more radical than that it isn't just that when i
5:30:02
talk about god i'm saying things that i don't know to be true
5:30:08
his argument really seems to lead to the conclusion that i don't know what i'm saying
5:30:13
what i'm saying doesn't really mean anything but he was very reluctant to draw that conclusion
5:30:19
what he tries to say is all i've done is to show that it's not a matter of knowledge or proof yes and his point on
5:30:26
that is i suppose is this that it whereas it's uh superstitious to rest on
5:30:31
faith over a question which can actually be decided one way or two if the question can't be decided one way
5:30:39
way or the other it's not irrational to have belief on one absolutely yes
5:30:45
yes at the very beginning of this discussion sir jeffrey you said that that
5:30:50
what the problem that could usefully be regarded as having as it were launched kant on his philosophical enterprise was
5:30:58
a perception of an apparent conflict between uh newtonian physics yes and the
5:31:05
requirements of ethics how in the light of everything we've said up to this point did he solve that problem
5:31:17
yes um to really a quite
5:31:25
minimal extent i think and i think this was something of which he was himself perfectly aware what he would
5:31:31
play is that
5:31:36
by making clear the distinction between the world
5:31:42
as a appearance as an object of experience and the world of things in themselves
5:31:48
he is in a position to say there is the world of appearances
5:31:54
and the physical sciences in principle give us the whole truth about that
5:32:00
and he believed that they did he had no doubt that newton had got it absolutely right
5:32:05
and that physicist's description of the world as an object of possible
5:32:11
experience was correct and could be exhaustive but he
5:32:16
says bear in mind that we are there talking about the world of appearances
5:32:23
there is also the topic of things in themselves
5:32:30
and there is room so to speak there
5:32:36
for other sorts of concepts altogether of free will of rational agency right
5:32:43
and wrong good and bad for soul there is room for these concepts not in
5:32:50
the world of appearance but outside the world of appearance
5:32:57
of course he saw that on his own principles he would have
5:33:02
to say that these other matters couldn't be topics of knowledge
5:33:09
and had you said do you know that there is such a thing
5:33:14
as free will he would consistently have said no i do not know any such thing all i
5:33:21
know is that there is room for that possibility and that i can't help believing that
5:33:28
there is oh certainly yes you would have gone on to say that too given that on this view ethics comes to
5:33:35
us somehow from outside the world of all possible knowledge does he have a view about where it comes from or how we get
5:33:43
it um well he thought it came out of reason
5:33:49
i think it will help us to understand that problem further if if you tell us
5:33:55
what the main conclusions of his moral philosophy were it's quite impossible i think in the context of this discussion
5:34:02
to go into the arguments with which he supported those yes but if you are able out to outline the
5:34:09
conclusions for us briefly i think that will contribute to an understanding i think one could say something quite
5:34:16
briefly about that what he really tries to do in his moral
5:34:22
philosophy is somehow extract
5:34:27
the essentials of morality from the
5:34:33
pure concept of rationality he says the the essential thing about
5:34:40
any agent of whom one can think or speak in moral terms is that he must be a
5:34:46
rational being capable of thinking of reasons for and against doing this and that
5:34:52
and he tries to argue that the essential requirements of morality
5:34:59
are really built into the concept of rationality itself
5:35:05
um essentially trying to show that
5:35:11
uh well he seems to try to show that
5:35:16
um uh only body of principles of action
5:35:22
um corresponding to our principles of morality
5:35:28
could consistently i.e rationally be universally adopted by a community of
5:35:35
rational beings that's what he tries to show and there is the famous categorical
5:35:40
imperative which is directly derives from that yes perhaps i should ask you to formulate it rather when he says act
5:35:47
only on that maxim which by which you can at the same time will
5:35:54
that it should be a universal law um and i think that is the idea he he
5:36:01
wants to say that what morality really imposes on us is
5:36:07
conditions on conduct which
5:36:12
require and i think he also thinks uniquely determine the ascent of any possible community of
5:36:20
rational creatures that's what he's trying to do now
5:36:25
kant's philosophy is notoriously difficult to understand the first encounter and i'm sure that many of the
5:36:31
people listening to this discussion between you and me are experiencing this difficulty now
5:36:37
i think fundamental to the difficulty is his contention
5:36:43
that of things as they are in themselves we simply have no knowledge and no way
5:36:49
of acquiring knowledge that we are as it were permanently screened off from this
5:36:55
by our own and these are partly limitations as it were in time and space yes
5:37:02
is it helpful do you think to say to p to point out to people look in a quite different context
5:37:09
something very much of this sort is what many religious people have always believed that as it were real reality is
5:37:18
outside this world of our experience outside space and time
5:37:23
and that this world of our experience is ephemeral and perhaps uh illusory in something yes metaphysical sense is it
5:37:30
helpful to say that or do you think that just obscures the issue no i don't think it does
5:37:37
and if for example and one raises the rather um
5:37:43
in a sense hypothetical and perhaps idle question what
5:37:48
sort of being one would have to be to be acquainted with things as they are
5:37:54
in themselves the only possible answer you can get out of can't is you have to be god in fact
5:38:02
um that's to say you would be acquainted with things in some timeless way and without any
5:38:09
kind of spatial limitations and with no particular sensory
5:38:15
limitations on the mode of your acquaintance and i'm not thinking in english or
5:38:21
french or any other particular language your acquaintance with the universe would be not subject to any of these
5:38:27
limitations and if you say well and what would i have to be to be like that the only
5:38:33
answer is i'd have to be god it's a very striking feature i think of kant's philosophy that although he
5:38:39
conducted his philosophy impeccably in accordance with the criteria of philosophy he didn't call on faith or
5:38:46
revelation or anything of that kind but relied purely on argument and was working as it were entirely from within
5:38:53
the central tradition of western philosophy yes through predecessors like loch and hume and leibniz and so on
5:39:00
nevertheless he does arrive at conclusions which are strikingly
5:39:07
capable of cohabiting with religious belief well yes except for the uncomfortable
5:39:15
fact which we mentioned earlier that he has to say that
5:39:20
strictly speaking all discourse on those topics is unintelligible to us we don't
5:39:27
really know what we mean and that's a proposition that theologians have been a bit cherry of
5:39:34
accepting they might might even say that nowadays more and more are accepted well that may be true
5:39:41
yes another uh difficulty about reading can't is is simply the prose style i
5:39:47
mean there are philosophers um hume is one plato's another schopenhauer's another who are beautiful
5:39:53
writers and a pleasure to read but khan's best friend couldn't say that about him
5:39:58
it's opaque it's difficult it's obscure yes why did he write so badly
5:40:05
i think there are perhaps three things one might say i think partly
5:40:11
it's due to the fact that you mentioned right at the beginning that he was
5:40:17
by profession and very single-mindedly by profession and academic
5:40:22
and he does write in a very heavily academic style with a great taste but technical terminology and jargon and
5:40:32
what he called architect tonic it is all very academic
5:40:38
but another important point i think to remember about the critiques and this again connects with something you said
5:40:43
at the beginning uh was that um by the time he was seriously launched on writing what he
5:40:49
knew to be his sort of master works he hoped would be his master works he was nearly 60
5:40:57
and he was actually dogged by the thought that he might die before he'd got it all down
5:41:04
and there's no doubt that those hundreds of pages between the ages of 16 and 60 and 70
5:41:11
were written extremely fast he was just writing in a hurry and i think that hasn't of course 200
5:41:17
years ago the expectation of life simply was very much shorter than now and it was perfectly reasonable for him to
5:41:22
think that he might die quite yes so that he was writing in a hurry
5:41:28
another point that slightly less obvious one is that
5:41:34
he was and still by that date somewhat unusually
5:41:39
writing in german which had at that date barely become
5:41:45
accepted as a sort of decent language for academic and learned use um
5:41:53
i leibniz i don't believe leibniz ever wrote german it was all either french or that either french or latin yes and um
5:42:01
there just wasn't a sort of established style of academic learning german prose
5:42:08
for kant to adopt and as for example for barclay and hume there was i mean english had become a well-established
5:42:15
language for that kind of learned use and i think that may have been a problem to him he had no sort of models it's a
5:42:22
great sadness i think because it it's it's a huge unnecessary obstacle yes understanding the work of somebody who
5:42:28
after all yes it is almost incomparable thinker yes i said at the very beginning of this discussion
5:42:34
that he's been regarded for generations by large numbers of professional philosophers as the greatest philosopher
5:42:41
since the ancient greeks why is his reputation at quite that pinnacle
5:42:48
i think that there were i think i would mention uh two qualities
5:42:53
as entitling him to his pinnacle of fame
5:42:59
i think he was quite exceptionally penetrating in in the sense that he was
5:43:07
able to see an intellectual problem in something which had previously been
5:43:13
taken for granted and is not worth much attention
5:43:18
and he was able to see where the problems were um and i think and that's one of the
5:43:24
greatest philosophical gifts to be able to see that there is a problem where everybody else is going on quite happily
5:43:31
without thinking about it much then i think the other thing and this
5:43:36
connects perhaps with his academic professionalism um he was extremely good at seeing how
5:43:44
how it all fitted together and how what he'd said on this topic might
5:43:49
reap a cuss so to speak on what he'd said somewhere else and he was very self-conscious about and professionally
5:43:56
methodical in this sort of way he does i must say to me make
5:44:02
writers like say lock and barkley and indeed hume excellent there they are look rather like amateurs
5:44:09
thank you very much sir jeffrey few philosophers have more obviously
Peter Singer on Hegel and Marx
5:44:16
changed the world than hegel both personally through his influence on german nationalism and indirectly
5:44:22
through the work of his most famous philosophical disciple karl marx after whom a great many governments in our own
5:44:28
day actually call themselves so if we want to see some of the practical consequences of hegel's ideas
5:44:35
all we have to do is look at the world in which we ourselves live his influence on philosophy was
5:44:41
correspondingly great in fact it's been said that the history of philosophy since hegel can be understood as a
5:44:47
succession of varying reactions against his work he was born in stuttgart in 1770
5:44:54
a teacher of one sort or another for most of his life he eventually became professor of philosophy at heidelberg
5:45:00
and then in berlin as a philosopher he was a late developer but by the time of his death in 1831 he
5:45:07
was very much the dominant figure in philosophy throughout the whole of germany
5:45:12
the titles of some of his most influential works are the phenomenology of mind the science of logic the
5:45:19
philosophy of right and the philosophy of history hegel had several followers who
5:45:26
themselves became well known but far and away the most famous is karl marx
5:45:31
marx was born in germany in 1818 and as a young student of philosophy was very much a hegelian he didn't become a
5:45:38
socialist until his mid-twenties when he began to develop that rich and highly original mixture of german philosophy
5:45:46
french politics and british economics which is marxism together with a wealthy young
5:45:52
industrialist friday engels he wrote the communist manifesto in 1848
5:45:57
the partnership between marx and engels must be just about the most momentous collaboration in the history of ideas
5:46:05
engels kept marx for most of his life so that he could produce his writings and it was a life spent largely in exile
5:46:12
because of marx's political activities at the age of 31 he went to live in london and stayed there until his death
5:46:19
in 1883 he's buried in highgate cemetery for many years he worked in the british
5:46:24
museum in its reading room and it was there that he wrote his masterpiece das capital published in 1867
5:46:33
marxism isn't quite philosophy in the accepted meaning of the term but there's obviously a major philosophical element
5:46:40
in it and that element always remained hegelian what i propose to do in this program is
5:46:46
devote the bulk of the discussion to hegel and then show how some of the most important of the ideas we've been
5:46:52
discussing were incorporated into marxism with me to do this is someone who has
5:46:58
published excellent introductions to the works of both thinkers peter singer professor of philosophy at monash
5:47:05
university in melbourne australia professor singer hegel is notorious for
5:47:10
being difficult to read for being obscure he's often described as the most obscure of all the major philosophers
5:47:17
yet your little book about him has the conspicuous merit of discussing his central ideas in ordinary plain english
5:47:25
i hope you're going to be able to do the same on this program when you're confronted with the task of
5:47:31
expounding hegel's ideas where do you find the most convenient place to start
5:47:37
i start with the philosophy of history because the history in hagel is quite concrete
5:47:42
part of the difficulty with hagel is that he's so abstract but the history because it's concrete is an easy way in
5:47:48
to the more abstract parts of his philosophy well that in itself is already a new departure in philosophy
5:47:53
isn't it because no major philosopher before hegel regarded history or the
5:47:58
philosophy of history as being important yes it is a departure compare it with kant for instance
5:48:04
can't had a view of human nature as human beings eternally divided
5:48:10
between their reasoning element and their brute desires it's a bit like the
5:48:15
old picture of man is halfway between the apes and the angels and for can't that was just a fact of
5:48:21
human nature we would always be torn with this division this conflict but hegel said no wait a minute this
5:48:28
isn't something immutable look at greek society greek society hegel said was more harmonious people were not
5:48:35
conscious of this gulf or division their desires were in harmony with their
5:48:41
reason so the point that kant is talking to is talking about this division is something
5:48:46
that has occurred historically has developed with the rise of individual
5:48:52
conscience in protestant europe and because it's happened historically it need not be a permanent feature it
5:48:59
could in some other period actually again be overcome and a harmony restored
5:49:05
hegel looked at all important concepts in this historical way didn't he he saw them as being embedded in human
5:49:11
life in ways of life in societies and as societies change so the concepts
5:49:18
change isn't that right yes that's absolutely right uh he saw that
5:49:23
there was development in the way history occurred that it was always moving forward it was always a process
5:49:30
never static and he had a name for the way in which it moved forward he called this the dialectical process now can you explain
5:49:36
exactly what in hegel's mind the dialectical process was let's go back to the example i mentioned
5:49:42
before greek society he saw as a harmony but as a simple harmony
5:49:48
a simple harmony in the sense that people had not developed the alternative notion of individual conscience there
5:49:55
was harmony between the individual and society because individuals hadn't really thought
5:50:00
about things themselves now into that simple harmony there came
5:50:06
in the person in fact of of socrates whom hagel considers a world historical figure
5:50:11
they came the idea of questioning this harmony socrates went around asking people what is justice what is virtue
5:50:19
and when they tried to answer they realized that they'd accepted certain conventions which socrates had no
5:50:25
trouble in showing could not be sustained so the simple harmony of greek society
5:50:31
broke down and because socrates broke it down incidentally hegel thinks that the athenians were quite right to condemn
5:50:37
socrates to death he was genuinely corrupting and subverting athenian society
5:50:43
but that was an essential part of a historical process because ultimately and hegel fills in the gaps the steps
5:50:50
but ultimately that led to the rise of individual conscience and a second necessary element and the
5:50:57
opposite of greek society so we've moved from what hegel calls the thesis
5:51:02
to the antithesis the antithesis of greek society's individual conscience
5:51:08
risen to its height in protestant europe but that too turns out to be unstable it
5:51:13
leads to the destruction of the french revolution and the terror that followed the french revolution and so that too
5:51:20
must give way to a synthesis to a third stage which combines harmony
5:51:26
and individual conscience and very often in this process that then again serves as the new thesis from which a further
5:51:34
antithesis will arise and the process will continue now this notion of dialectical change that you've just
5:51:40
explained has been so influential ever since hegel and it's enormously influential today through marxism which
5:51:46
embodies it that i think we must get it completely clear in our mind so let me just go over it again
5:51:52
the idea is isn't it that hegel put forward that the reason why we human beings are
5:51:59
involved in a process of perpetual change is that every complex situation contains
5:52:06
within itself conflicting elements which therefore destabilize the situation and
5:52:12
therefore the situation cannot go on indefinitely it breaks down into
5:52:18
something else within which those conflicts are dissolved or assuaged but then of course in the
5:52:24
new situation you get new conflicts and so it goes on indefinitely so you
5:52:31
get as you put it just now thesis antithesis synthesis which becomes a new
5:52:36
thesis using his terminology and this hegelians and following their marxists
5:52:42
think gives us the key to history to understanding historical change the dialectical process now up to
5:52:50
that point in the explanation it would have been open to hagel to say that uh the direction that this change
5:52:57
took was purely accidental it could be the random outcome of innumerable random
5:53:03
conflicts but he doesn't say that does he he actually thinks this linear process has a direction has a goal
5:53:11
that's right and the goal for hegel is the greater development of mind towards freedom
5:53:18
we are moving always towards consciousness of freedom towards realizing human freedom and
5:53:25
understanding freedom and that is a process of increasing awareness of freedom and of
5:53:31
increasing knowledge of ourselves now what is this change happening to i
5:53:37
mean wherever we talk of change in any context whatever there must be something identifiable that changes
5:53:44
now what is it that's changing in other words is he writing about whole societies is he writing about
5:53:51
individuals what what is he writing about in this course the short answer is that he's
5:53:56
writing neither about individuals nor about societies but about what he calls
5:54:02
geist now that german word geist is a difficult one to translate
5:54:08
the easiest way perhaps would be to say that it happens to mind mind is one normal translation of the german word
5:54:15
geist we mean when we talk about mental illness the german word geistes crunchuft is
5:54:21
is mentally ill so you could say it's happening to mind to your mind and mine or all our
5:54:26
individual minds but mind also has another meaning which goes beyond that
5:54:31
the notion of spirit we talk about the zeitgeist the spirit of the times or we talk about geist when germans talk
5:54:39
about the father the son and the holy ghost the word ghost exactly
5:54:44
so it also has therefore a somewhat spiritual or religious flavor which
5:54:51
suggests that in some sense there's a reality above and beyond your and my individual mind and so you could say
5:54:58
it's happening to mind but mind with a capital m not just mind in the sense of individual
5:55:04
human minds so is hegel saying then that total reality is something
5:55:10
mental or spiritual or this word geist may be poised between the mental and the spiritual
5:55:16
and that all the processes that we're talking about are our processes ultimately of this ultimate mental or
5:55:24
spiritual thing yes that's the ultimate view that hegel comes down to that reality is
5:55:31
geist it's ultimately mental or intellectual and these processes happen
5:55:37
to geist to mind as it develops along the pro along the way now to some people listening to the discussion this might
5:55:43
already begin to sound like a very bizarre idea so i think it's worth pointing out that in fact we're all very
5:55:49
familiar with something similar to this in the case of religious beliefs even if we ourselves are not religious people i
5:55:56
mean many religious believers including many christians believe that all of reality
5:56:02
is ultimately spiritual and that all of reality ultimately has a
5:56:07
spiritual or significance or meaning and i suppose hegel is saying something very
5:56:13
closely related to that is he though not necessarily religious in the conventional sense
5:56:19
yes but the difference might be that the orthodox christian view i think holds that that god is spiritual but separate
5:56:26
from the world and the world is mundane and material although it has a spiritual significance
5:56:31
certainly but it's separate from it but for hegel there's a closer union between the two
5:56:37
you could present the opposite of the christian view by saying that hagel is a pantheist that he
5:56:42
believes that god is in the world and in everything that's perhaps not quite true either but it's somewhere between the
5:56:49
traditional christian conception and the pantheistic one that reality is part of god everything is a
5:56:56
manifestation of god if you want to call it that in fact i mean it would be true to say that ever since hegel there has
5:57:01
been a dispute between hegel scholars or philosophers about precisely this
5:57:06
question relating to hegel's philosophy is hegel's philosophy ultimately
5:57:12
religious or not there are some who've said that it is there are some have maintained that it isn't which side of
5:57:17
that debate do you come down on i think that it is immensely valuable to try and interpret hegel as if he were
5:57:24
not religious because then you find that you can make good sense of a large part of hegel's
5:57:30
philosophy in a non-religious way just interpreting him as talking about mind and the common element in mind being our
5:57:37
common ability to reason the fact that our minds are structured in similar principles
5:57:42
but i think i have to admit that though you can push that a long way you don't really make a hundred percent
5:57:49
sense of hagel in that way the last 10 perhaps has to assume that there is some
5:57:54
religious or crazy religious view of of mind or spirit that lies behind what he's saying
5:58:01
now we've talked about the view of the of reality as a historical process which he introduced into western thought it's
5:58:08
a major idea and we've talked about this notion of dialectical change which he introduced
5:58:14
and which is a living idea to this day another important concept which i think i'm writing saying he coined certainly
5:58:21
he made it famous and which has come back again into what one might call intellectual fashion in recent decades
5:58:28
is the concept of alienation hegel had a great deal to say about alienation didn't he now what exactly
5:58:34
did he mean by that term by alienation hegel meant the idea that
5:58:40
something which is in fact us or part of us seems to us foreign alien and hostile
5:58:48
let me give you an example he presents a picture of what he calls the unhappy soul which is
5:58:54
an alienated form of religion the unhappy soul is the person who prays to
5:59:00
a god whom he regards as all-powerful all-knowing and all-good
5:59:05
and who sees himself by contrast as powerless ignorant and base
5:59:13
so this person is unhappy because he demeans himself and puts all those qualities into some
5:59:21
being which he sees as separate for himself hegel says that this is wrong we are in fact
5:59:27
part of god or if you like we are projecting our qualities into god and we
5:59:33
should take that back the way to overcome that kind of alienation would be to realize that we and god are one
5:59:39
and that we have those qualities they are not something separate and foreign specifically that these are
5:59:46
human and perhaps only human qualities which we are projecting onto an all-powerful being denying them to
5:59:53
ourselves when it is in fact we who have them i mean they originate with humanity the
5:59:58
claim that they are only human was actually made by one of his later disciples ludwig feuerbach he wouldn't
6:00:04
have said that but he would have said that we and that kind of divine spirit are all part of the same reality geist
6:00:10
or mind now you've explained very clearly i think how hegel saw total reality
6:00:16
as being a process of change which was moving forward in a certain way the
6:00:22
dialectical movement what is it going towards what is the
6:00:28
goal what's the end of this movement the endpoint of the dialectical process
6:00:35
is mind coming to know itself as the ultimate reality and thus as seeing
6:00:42
everything that it took to be foreign and hostile to itself as in fact part of itself
6:00:47
and that for hegel is simultaneously a state of absolute knowledge when mind
6:00:53
knows recognizes at last itself as the ultimate reality and also a state of
6:00:58
absolute freedom when mind instead of being controlled by external forces is able to
6:01:07
order the world in a rational way because now it sees that the world is in fact itself and it only has to
6:01:13
implement its own principle of rationality onto the world to organize the world rationally
6:01:19
now the interesting thing about this culminating process is that because it occurs once mind understands
6:01:27
that it is the reality of everything if you ask the question when does this actually happen
6:01:34
well it happens when hegel's mind hegel's own mind in his philosophical writings and thoughts grasped the idea
6:01:42
that mind is everything and then he's he's achieved this it's not just that hegel describes the goal the
6:01:49
culmination of all this process but hegel's philosophy actually is the very culmination of the whole process he's
6:01:55
describing so when hegel published his main works that was total reality at
6:02:01
last achieving awareness of itself achieving self-knowledge yes it's an
6:02:06
amazing piece of sort of grandiose uh self-projection on the part of a
6:02:11
philosophy i'm not sure quite that hagel realized that it could be seen in this light
6:02:17
now one thing that strikes one about the aim towards all which all this
6:02:22
is moving in the way you just put it is that it's sometimes seen as freedom
6:02:28
sometimes seen as self-knowledge and hegel clearly did think that those were
6:02:34
in some sense the same thing and i think a little more needs to be said about that because it's not at all clear i
6:02:40
think to most people how self-knowledge can itself constitute freedom
6:02:45
well self-knowledge becomes freedom because of the particular nature of mind
6:02:52
and of hegel's idea that mind is the ultimate reality of the world
6:02:58
you see in the historical process up to the point at which we recognize that if
6:03:03
you like it's our world that we are all up to that point we have really been pawns in the game we haven't been
6:03:09
controlling the game we haven't been controlling the historical stage because things have
6:03:15
been happening to us without us realizing or understanding why they happen because what we take to be
6:03:23
foreign and hostile aspects of the world are in fact part of us but once we come to see that
6:03:30
we are everything in the world then we understand the process we've grasped
6:03:36
if you like the laws of historical development and we see that those laws are in fact our own reason they are the
6:03:42
very laws of our mind and our thinking this was this behind the famous quotation that's often made from hegel
6:03:49
the real is the rational and the rational is the real that what exists does correspond to
6:03:56
what is rational that's right and when we come to see that then we are free because we see
6:04:03
the rationality of reality and it no longer strikes us as something
6:04:08
contrary to our interests we no longer struggle against it we understand it as in fact our own
6:04:14
our own rational principle and we are free to flow along with it and indeed to to
6:04:20
order it and direct it in accordance with those laws of reason now one characteristic of hegel's thought which
6:04:26
you've made very clear is that he always sees ideas not just as existing in the abstract and certainly not being
6:04:33
timeless and unchanging in the way that say plato saw them but as being embodied
6:04:39
in societies and institutions and historical realities which change now
6:04:46
given that fact what sort of society does hegel see this whole process as
6:04:52
culminating in what sort of society is it leading towards
6:04:58
well as you'd expect from what we've been saying it's a rational society a rationally ordered society but i must
6:05:05
make clear what that is for hegel because it's not the society of pure reason hegel saw the society of pure
6:05:12
reason as typified by the kind of thing that the french revolutionaries wanted to do you know they didn't just uh get
6:05:18
rid of of the king and the nobles and of religion but they tried to make everything rational they said why have
6:05:25
months of irregular days why not make them all the same day number of days why
6:05:30
have weeks of seven days let's make them 10 like our decimal system of measurement and so on now hegel saw that
6:05:36
as leading to a kind of madly abstract notion of reason rather like for instance the view of a town planner who
6:05:43
might look at a map of london and say oh well your streets all run crooked and traffic has to make detours and so on
6:05:50
let's get rid of this let's tear all the buildings down make nice straight streets
6:05:55
in each block we'll put a big high-rise apartment we can fit more people in you can have a smooth green lawn outside for
6:06:01
the children to play and it'll all be beautiful and ordered and rational we've actually had that in london and it's been catastrophic that's right and hegel
6:06:08
would have predicted that it would have been catastrophic because it was abstract reason taken to an extreme
6:06:14
for hegel what a rational ordering of of london town planning would be would be
6:06:20
to look at the real that is london as it exists find what's rational in the real and of course it has developed the way
6:06:26
it did for certain reasons so there's the rational element and then try and follow those reasons
6:06:33
through in a way that fulfills the rationale behind london's development without
6:06:38
trying to raise it down and start anew to get rid of some of the arbitrary and capricious points perhaps that that are
6:06:44
particular problems but basically to find what's rational and what's real and enhance it and develop it and allow it
6:06:51
to fulfill itself one criticism that's always been brought forward against this conception of the state the rational
6:06:57
state by uh liberal philosophers in the anglo-saxon tradition especially is that
6:07:04
by seeing the state as an organic whole which behaves rationally and orders
6:07:09
everything rationally hegel leaves no room at all for individual
6:07:15
dissent criticism freedom one can say eccentricity there's no room in the
6:07:21
system for the individual to behave as he likes what's your comment on that
6:07:27
i don't think there's any evidence that hager was opposed to some individual freedoms
6:07:32
but what is true is that his view of freedom was not the standard anglo-saxon
6:07:38
liberal view of freedom to look at the difference between the two let's shift to a somewhat different area
6:07:44
economics and the idea of freedom in in the economic sphere in the market according to one view the liberal view
6:07:52
freedom consists simply in people being able to do as they prefer if i prefer to wear an orange shirt this
6:08:00
spring for instance then i i'm free if i can do that if i prefer to buy a deodorant i'm free if i can do that and
6:08:06
that's all that the liberal economist will ask are you free to choose the
6:08:12
preferences that you have to fulfill them but some of the more radical economists have questioned that and
6:08:18
they've said that's a very superficial notion of freedom you should ask why do you want to wear an orange shirt this
6:08:24
season why do you want to use a deodorant why don't you accept that you know a certain amount of natural
6:08:29
body odor isn't a problem or whatever and the radical economists will say the reason is that you've been manipulated
6:08:35
there are people who want to make a profit out of you buying their deodorant out of you thinking that the clothes and
6:08:40
the colors you wore last season are no longer good enough this season so you've been manipulated you're not free
6:08:46
you have to ask not only can you do what you prefer but why do you prefer
6:08:51
what you prefer are they rational preferences are they preferences that satisfy your needs now
6:08:57
hegel would have been in the latter camp he would have said freedom is more than just
6:09:02
ability to follow your own caprice freedom must consist in fulfilling yourself as a rational
6:09:09
individual that sounds all very well but surely what it's going to mean in practice is that i i think i know what i
6:09:16
want i want to wear an orange shirt this spring and i want to go out and buy a deodorant in hot weather but we have a
6:09:22
state perhaps which says no no you you you think you want those but those are
6:09:27
not rational preferences on your part we know what's best for you we know even
6:09:33
what you would want if your preferences were rational in other words you get a state that not only knows what's good
6:09:39
for you better than you do yourself you actually get a state that knows what you want better than you know yourself and
6:09:46
surely that's authoritarian in the extreme in its relation to the individual
6:09:52
i think in practice you're probably right and i don't know that hagel has any reply to that objection the only thing that he can say is that while it
6:09:59
might be very difficult in practice to work out how you could have a society in which individuals genuinely
6:10:05
realize their rational self without an authoritarian state that doesn't mean that you've overcome the problem by the
6:10:11
liberal laissez faire notion i mean we still do have to face that problem that people's
6:10:17
wants and desires might be being manipulated and to the extent that they are it's perhaps misleading to say that
6:10:22
they're really free in other words it's still a problem hegel doesn't necessarily have the right answer to it
6:10:28
let's just take stock for a moment where we've got in the discussion right at the very beginning i asked you what you
6:10:34
thought was the easiest way in to an understanding of hegel's philosophy as a
6:10:39
whole and you replied that you thought the best starting point was with the philosophy of history so we started
6:10:45
there and in fact we've continued our discussion in a straight line so to speak to the point that we've now
6:10:50
reached well now are we now in a better position to understand other aspects of hegel's
6:10:57
philosophy than we were i think we've already in fact grasped some of the essentials
6:11:02
of hegel's logic for instance one of its most abstract points because we've grasped the dialectic which is part of
6:11:08
logic the idea of the thesis antithesis synthesis now in the logic one of the points hegel
6:11:14
makes is that logic is not just a matter of form as separate from content which is the way
6:11:20
the traditional logic of aristotle was interpreted he says that form and content are together
6:11:27
and we can see why he says that because he thinks that this dialectic is something that is realized in the actual
6:11:33
process of history in logic he says you study that in the sense of you study truth without its
6:11:40
husk he put it that is the eternal immutable form of it irrespective of a particular historical content but in
6:11:47
fact it's always linked to that content so that's one of the key ideas of the logic and another point that we've also
6:11:54
just touched on is this notion of ultimate reality and the way in which it's in some sense a matter of mind
6:12:01
rather than a matter of uh material things it seems to me looking at the exposition
6:12:07
of hegel's ideas that you've put forward up to this point that there's one central concept out of which almost all
6:12:14
the important other ideas naturally arise the central concept is that
6:12:20
understanding reality isn't understanding a given state of affairs it's understanding a process a process
6:12:27
of perpetual change the other concepts arise in the following natural order it seems to me
6:12:34
if one asks oneself what is it that's changing hegel's answer is it is geist
6:12:41
which is changing and you've explained what he means by that rather difficult concept mind spirit whatever it may be
6:12:48
if one says why is it changing the answer is because to begin with it's in
6:12:53
a state of alienation and you've explained that if one says what is the process of change what is
6:13:00
the pattern of change the answer is it's the dialectical process
6:13:06
if you ask where is all this change heading the answer is well at the political and
6:13:11
social level it's heading towards an organic society which we've discussed at the philosophical level it's all heading
6:13:18
towards absolute knowledge which you've at least touched on so in this way all these central concepts of geist
6:13:25
alienation dialectical change the organic society all arise out of a
6:13:31
consideration of this central idea of reality as a process as a historical
6:13:37
process a change now we've been able to put this very clearly
6:13:43
and the next question i want to ask you is why didn't hegel we said right at the beginning that he's
6:13:48
notoriously obscure sometimes philosophy students read out passages of hegel aloud just to make everybody laugh
6:13:55
because it sounds like such gobbledygook you can read page after page of hegel
6:14:00
sometimes and think what the hell is he saying now why wasn't he clear when it's
6:14:07
possible to be clear about his ideas as you indeed in your book have shown some of his less charitable critics
6:14:13
thought that he was deliberately obscure in order to appear more profound in order to cover what they took to be the
6:14:19
shallowness of his ideas but i don't think his ideas are shallow i think they're very deep and profound and that
6:14:25
in fact the difficulty comes from the nature of the ideas one of his students said that whereas an eloquent lecturer
6:14:32
might have had everything off by heart and would arrange it well and trot it out clearly hegel was always dredging up difficult
6:14:40
ideas as he went along as he lectured he was bringing these ideas to the surface
6:14:45
with great difficulty and that's the style the style is one of
6:14:50
someone who's is thinking aloud and having difficulty with the material we may very well regret that he didn't
6:14:55
then revise and polish it but in the context of german philosophical
6:15:01
style at the time it's not so surprising that he didn't feel the need for clarity that you just mentioned because after
6:15:08
all kant and fichter other contemporaries were also very obscure and they were still regarded as great
6:15:13
philosophers but the next question that that gives rise to is how did it come about that a philosopher who was so
6:15:19
obscure and so difficult to understand acquired even in his lifetime such
6:15:24
immense influence i think that's partly due to his situation at the university of berlin
6:15:31
which was the capital of prussia which was then the rising state in germany at the time
6:15:36
and also due to the fertility of his ideas in a variety of fields you see the
6:15:41
influence that hegel had is not just an influence in philosophy it's an influence in theology in history in
6:15:49
politics in economics even in law now the fact that hegel's ideas could be
6:15:56
applied in those ways shows how fruitful his approach and particularly the historical elements of his approach were
6:16:03
because it was that historical idea of things as having developed as being a process that could
6:16:09
be applied by scholars in all these different areas let's come now to the immediate afterlife of hegel's ideas one
6:16:17
of the first things that happened when he died was that his followers split into two movements didn't they they were
6:16:22
known as the young hegelians and the old hegelians or alternatively the left hegelians and the right hegelians can
6:16:28
you tell us something about this division the writer galions were the people who
6:16:35
thought that hegel's philosophy implied that something like the prussian state was
6:16:41
the organic state which hegel was pointing to
6:16:46
they thought that hegel had himself said this in the philosophy of right his most explicitly political work he described a
6:16:53
state a constitutional monarchy not very different from the prussian state and so they thought that there was no
6:16:59
need really for further change they were the conservative or right-wing hegelians
6:17:05
left hegelian said the basic thrust of hegel's philosophy is much more radical than that you see
6:17:11
hagel talked as we said at the beginning about overcoming the division between reason and desire or between morality
6:17:19
and self-interest that's a very fundamental change to bring about you can't say that that's
6:17:24
occurred in in the pressure of 1830 or whatever so they said the thrust of hegel's
6:17:31
philosophy is for a much more far-reaching change a revolutionary change now they had to admit that in the
6:17:36
philosophy of right hegel hadn't written as if you're a revolutionary but they'd pointed out the fact that hagel's salary
6:17:42
was paid by the state of prussia so they said hagel compromised he sold out but
6:17:48
we must be truer to hegel than hero was to himself we must carry the ideas forward
6:17:54
until we get to the point at which these thesis antithesis of reason and desire
6:18:01
morality and self-interest are overcome and we reach the synthesis of a harmonious society in which those gulfs
6:18:08
and divisions in human nature are reconciled and of course as soon as you talk about the revolutionary followers
6:18:13
of hegel onto the scene march is the greatest revolutionary thinker of the modern era karl marx because he was a
6:18:21
young one of the young hegelians and i think it's very striking after the whole of our discussion up to this point to
6:18:28
list the fundamental ideas of hegelianism that we've talked about which marx simply
6:18:35
took over and incorporated into marxism among these are first the idea that
6:18:41
reality is a historical process second that this process changes by a
6:18:49
dialectical movement dialectical change historical dialectic
6:18:55
third that it's all going towards a goal fourth that that goal is a conflict-free
6:19:02
society and fifth that until we get there to the conflict-free society we're condemned to
6:19:09
remain in one form or another of alienation now all these absolutely central ideas
6:19:16
of marxism were taken over lock stock and barrel from hegel
6:19:22
one has to say that there's one huge difference and it's this that
6:19:28
whereas hegel as we've been saying all along was an idealist and to hegel all these things were seen as happening to
6:19:34
mind or spirit to geist as you said in the case of marx he saw all these
6:19:40
things as happening to something material marx was a materialist but the whole pattern of ideas remains the same
6:19:48
it's as if marx has taken over a great long set of equations from hegel
6:19:54
substituted a different value for x in the equations mata instead of mind but kept the whole
6:20:01
set of equations in every other respect the same that's right and you can see it for instance in marx's materialist
6:20:07
conception of history the key thing in marx's thought where history develops
6:20:13
by the economic base the material side the forces of production
6:20:18
as dominating the mental so that our ideas our religion our politics
6:20:24
all flow from the kind of economic structure that we have in our society
6:20:30
and that's an inversion of hegel's idea as marx himself said he stood hegel on his head because for hegel it was the
6:20:37
development of ideas of ideas of freedom and so on that led to the formation of particular societies and particular
6:20:44
historical epochs do you think that karl marx could be said to have made any important original contribution of his
6:20:50
own to philosophy i don't think marx made important contributions to philosophy in the
6:20:56
narrow sense in which we talk about problems of the ultimate nature of reality
6:21:02
i think that marx was certainly a materialist but he didn't
6:21:08
argue for his materialism as a philosopher he really accepted it as something that was pretty obvious that
6:21:13
what mattered was was the material world this this kind of thing and not something
6:21:18
remote like geist which he more or less dismissed as a kind of speculative german metaphysical abstraction
6:21:25
so he didn't argue for that and he didn't therefore make contributions to that philosophical discussion
6:21:31
but what he did do was give us a kind of a vision a vision of a world in which
6:21:38
we are controlled by our economic circumstances
6:21:44
and in which we are therefore not free it's still rather like hegel and that we are we are pawns in the game of history
6:21:50
and in order to become free we must control the economic forces which after all are
6:21:57
our own forces what is economics after all but our own ways of providing for
6:22:02
food providing for shelter and so on so it's a vision in which the things that we do control us
6:22:09
and we instead must control them that's a powerful and broadly philosophical
6:22:15
vision of the human situation but it's not an important philosophical discovery
6:22:20
in the narrow or academic sense of the word philosophy now taking the two
6:22:25
very closely linked philosophies of hegelianism and marxism together what would you say has been their uh most
6:22:32
important or some of their most important positive contributions to human thought what have they given us
6:22:38
that's really useful in our understanding of the world well it's clear from what we've said that the idea
6:22:44
of history as a process which affects every aspect of our thinking and our ideas
6:22:49
is a crucial thing that's come from hegel and marx it became almost the dominant thing in the 19th century
6:22:54
didn't it as with evolution seeing everything as having evolved having developed we can't now imagine looking
6:23:01
at societies or ideas as timeless entities independent of their history and that's something that
6:23:07
we owe to hegel and max and that's so that's one very important thing the other thing
6:23:13
is this notion of freedom the idea that is distinct from the liberal notion that we cannot be free
6:23:20
unless we control our destiny unless we instead of being blown about by the
6:23:28
winds of economic circumstances for marx or the unseen hand of reason for hegel
6:23:34
unless we actually take control of it realize our own power realize the capacity of human beings
6:23:42
collectively to control our destiny and grasp that that may as you said have some dangerous
6:23:49
tendencies in it but it's a very important idea and i don't think it's one that we can ever give up once we've
6:23:56
been presented with it by hagel and marx now i do have to ask you about the minuses as well as the pluses
6:24:03
the ideas of both of these philosophers have become associated in the 20th century since their deaths with
6:24:09
totalitarianism hegel with german nationalism culminating in hitler and marx with
6:24:15
communism which was seen at its most horrific in the state created by stalin both of these societies were societies
6:24:22
that murdered millions of their own people now i'm not suggesting that either of the two philosophers would
6:24:28
ever have expected that and certainly not that they would have wanted it but they were both philosophers who
6:24:34
regarded the embodiment of ideas in history in institutions in social reality as being
6:24:41
an essential feature of ideas yet when their own ideas were so embodied they
6:24:47
had these catastrophic results why was that well i think their own ideas were
6:24:52
misembodied i don't think you can really trace hegelian ideas at all in hitler's
6:24:57
kind of racist nationalism you can't find that kind of racism they said so but you think that was a complete
6:25:03
mystery it was a complete misrepresentation of hegel in that case certainly and also and it's perhaps the ultimate
6:25:10
irony in in what happened to marx marx as i've been saying was a
6:25:15
philosopher of freedom he cherished freedom he hated subordination he was once asked by his daughter to write down
6:25:23
what is what the vice that he most attested was he replied servility
6:25:28
civility the very vice the very thing you needed to survive in stalin's totalitarianism of course
6:25:34
and yet it's true that these ideas did get misapplied did get distorted well now why what is there about the ideas
6:25:41
that led to this outcome i think in the end there's a faulty view
6:25:48
of human nature partly there's an attempt to show a greater unity than really exists
6:25:54
between human beings and we could trace this to hegel's notion of mind or geist as something which is above and beyond
6:26:01
the differences between individual minds but we find it also in in marx and in
6:26:06
the idea that if you change the economic circumstances you'll change human nature
6:26:13
and then we will all overcome the divisions between one another the division between
6:26:18
my interest and your interest and our individual interests and the interests of society they will all disappear
6:26:26
once we get rid of the economic structure which leads us to compete in the marketplace for money and wealth and
6:26:32
so on now it seems unfortunately that that has proven false that you can change the
6:26:39
economic basis but you don't get rid of the divisions between reason and desire between my
6:26:45
interests and yours or between individual and society that in fact what happens
6:26:50
once you make it impossible or very difficult for people to compete with each other for wealth is they then start
6:26:56
competing for status or for power or something of that sort and that's no better than it used to be in fact you
6:27:02
could say that in the case of stalin's society it proved to be worse
6:27:07
so i think that marx was mistaken in thinking that human nature would change thank you very much professor singer
6:27:14
it might be supposed that philosophy of all subjects must be free from the vagaries of fashion but that is not so
Frederick Copleston on Schopenhauer
6:27:21
in philosophy just as in other human activities in each generation there seems to be a reaction against the
6:27:27
values of the previous generation so writers that have been widely studied fall into neglect and new figures come
6:27:35
to the fore the outcome is apt to be that at any given time and place many of the same philosophers are being studied
6:27:41
by everyone and a number of other well-known philosophers are being neglected by at any rate nearly everyone
6:27:48
then a new generation comes along and re-evaluates one or two of the neglected philosophers so that they then come back
6:27:55
into fashion and so it goes on among the philosophers to whom this has happened most conspicuously in the last
6:28:01
200 years is schopenhauer for most of his lifetime roughly the first half of the 19th century he was
6:28:08
almost totally disregarded then in the second half of the 19th century he became one of the most famous and
6:28:14
influential of all philosophers then in the first half of the 20th century he fell into a neglect so
6:28:20
profound that even most teachers of philosophy no longer read him but now in our own time he is
6:28:26
unmistakably coming back to people's attention not least because he was a formative influence on one of the most
6:28:32
important 20th century philosophers wittgenstein arthur schopenhauer was born in danzig
6:28:39
now gdansk in 1788. his family had been rich hanseatic merchants for generations
6:28:45
and the upbringing he received was aimed not at an academic life but at training him to step into an international
6:28:51
business however he had no interest in the family firm he insisted on going to university
6:28:57
instead and thereafter he used his private means to finance a lifetime of independent study and writing
6:29:04
his doctorate thesis has become a minor classic in spite of its title on the four-fold root of the principle of
6:29:11
sufficient reason and he was still in his twenties during the four years when he composed his
6:29:16
masterpiece the world as will and representation which was published in 1818 the year in which he was 30.
6:29:23
from then until his death in 1860 at the age of 72 he published a great deal but
6:29:29
all of it was to extend or elaborate or enrich the philosophical system which he had constructed in his twenties and from
6:29:36
which he never departed he produced a huge collection of essays called perega and paralipomina and two
6:29:43
short but pungent books on ethics called the basis of morality and the freedom of
6:29:49
the will there was also a little book called on the will in nature designed to show that
6:29:54
his ideas were supported by discoveries in science most important of all he published a
6:30:00
revised edition of the world as will and representation which was more than twice the length of the original volume
6:30:07
there are several remarkable things about him although in direct succession to kant's his own work was securely in
6:30:14
the mainstream of western philosophy he was genuinely knowledgeable about hinduism and buddhism and is the only
6:30:21
major western philosopher to draw serious and interesting parallels between western and eastern thought
6:30:27
he was the first major western philosopher to be openly and explicitly atheist
6:30:32
he placed the arts higher in the scheme of things and had more to say about them than any other important philosopher and
6:30:39
perhaps partly for that reason his influence on creative artists of the front rank has exceeded that of any
6:30:45
other philosopher of the modern era he was himself among the supreme writers
6:30:50
of german prose many of his sentences are so brilliantly aphoristic that they've been torn out of context by the
6:30:57
hundred and published separately in little books of epigrams intellectually this is a catastrophe
6:31:04
because it obscures the fact that schopenhauer is first and foremost a system builder whose philosophy can be
6:31:09
understood only as a whole of the books in print about it in english at the time of making this
6:31:15
program i have to confess to you that the longest and most recent is by me but i can't very well interview myself so
6:31:22
i've invited the author of one of the others to come along and discuss schopenhauer with me my guest is in any case the most
6:31:29
distinguished living historian of philosophy in the english language frederick coppelston emeritus professor
6:31:35
in the university of london in addition to his extended treatment of schopenhauer in his nine volume history
6:31:42
of philosophy he's written a separate book about him called arthur schopenhauer philosopher of pessimism
6:31:49
well professor coppelston i think the place we ought to start is by addressing ourselves to the question of what it was
6:31:55
that schopenhauer set out to do perhaps i should let you take that up well mr speaker i think that um like other
6:32:02
original philosophers a great many of them schopenhauer wanted to understand the
6:32:08
world in which he found himself the world in which he lived or one could say
6:32:13
he tried to form a coherent unified interpretation of human experience ought
6:32:21
to gain conceptual mastery over the world
6:32:27
phenomena the plurality of phenomena i think that is it and to do that
6:32:32
schopenhauer thought that it was necessary to identify the underlying reality if one asked why he
6:32:40
thought that there was an underlying reality to um identify i suppose that the reason one
6:32:47
main reason is that he started from the premises of immanuel kant and that um
6:32:53
he thought that the the way in which we see the world is a human perspective
6:32:58
that the human mind is pre-programmed to see the world in certain ways that we can't for example
6:33:04
experience objects except the situated in space and time subject to spatial temporal relations and the subject to
6:33:12
the relation of causality but it obviously
6:33:17
doesn't follow that because things appear to one in a certain way that that is how they are apart from the way in
6:33:24
which they appear as they are in themselves can't certainly look at the the concept of a thing in itself as not
6:33:32
as that which appears but um is can be considered
6:33:38
in distinction from the from the appearance was a sensible idea and schopenhauer took that
6:33:45
over i think this is such an important idea and we're going to come back to it in different ways that it's worth going
6:33:52
over again because it is it's difficult i think for people who are new to him to really get hold of it sometimes
6:33:59
um can't had argued that uh all possible experience can only come to
6:34:05
us through our faculties through our sensory and mental apparatus and therefore what we could experience
6:34:11
depended not only on what there is out there to experience but also on the nature of the faculties
6:34:18
that we possess what our faculties could handle what they do to what they handle how they handle it and so on so that all
6:34:26
experience as such is subject dependent and he went on from
6:34:31
that to argue that therefore we could see total reality as being divided into
6:34:36
two there are things as they are in themselves independently of being
6:34:42
experienced and to such things we have no means of access
6:34:47
and then there's things as they appear to us the world of appearances the world as it
6:34:52
comes to us through experience and that's what we know that's the world of common sense the world of science the
6:35:00
our total world now uh said uh schopenhauer took this up
6:35:05
from kant and said now what can we get any pointers can we get any hints from a
6:35:11
close analysis of this world of experience as to what it might be
6:35:17
that underlies it as to what it might be that lies behind it that at least is part of the thought isn't it yes it is
6:35:24
i think it's important to remember that for shopping how there can be only one underlying reality a himself
6:35:32
took it as a matter of common sense i think that if there's a the table as it appears then there must be the table as
6:35:39
it is in itself and if the carpet as it appears then there's the carpet in itself that there are multitude of
6:35:46
things in themselves but of course if we think away spatial and temporal
6:35:52
relations and the causal relation there's no means of distinguishing one thing from another so that if the
6:35:59
underlying reality transcends space and time and causality and is quite other
6:36:05
than the world of phenomena then um canoe number one the plurality or
6:36:10
multiplicity belongs to the world of phenomena but the underlying reality must be
6:36:16
one these ideas that we are dealing with are really so difficult that i think that is worth going over again as well i
6:36:22
think it will help a lot of people that uh schopenhauer argued that for one thing
6:36:29
to be different from another thing for anything to be different from anything else at all this idea of
6:36:35
differentiation only made sense with reference either to time or to space or
6:36:41
to both if two things are identical in time and identical in space then they're
6:36:47
identical period they're the same thing so the notion of there being different things in the plural could only apply to
6:36:54
this world of our experience this world of space and time outside that world it could make no
6:37:02
sense whatever to talk of anything being different from anything else and therefore i'd just like to to complete
6:37:08
this thought therefore whatever there is outside this world of our experience must be one and
6:37:15
undifferentiated and in taking that step from can't he thought can't have been
6:37:21
wrong in talking about things in the plural in themselves things as they are in themselves that it must be
6:37:27
one undifferentiated something that lies behind this world now
6:37:33
in saying that he took an enormous stride towards one of the central
6:37:38
beliefs of hinduism and buddhism those religions also believe that behind
6:37:45
this highly differentiated plural variegated world of phenomena there is
6:37:51
one single undifferentiated something that manifests itself as this
6:37:56
world and one striking thing is that schopenhauer didn't get the belief from
6:38:02
buddhism or hinduism he got it by arguing from premises that he derived
6:38:08
from his predecessor western philosophers and then discovered that he'd reached a conclusion which was
6:38:14
similar to that of the buddhists and the hindus yes well i'd like to go back a moment to the
6:38:20
um to your what you've been just saying about the uh uh only one
6:38:26
underlying reality i think that if one starts from the premises of a manual count i mean i wouldn't myself but if
6:38:33
one does then schopenhauer is right because if the the snow beans are distinguishing
6:38:40
uh one thing in itself from another i think except as a matter of common sense
6:38:46
there's no formal way of distinguishing once you accept uh the canton premises that schopenhauer did taking the
6:38:52
argument to the next stage said to speak schopenhauer thought didn't he that if we analyze this world of phenomena
6:39:00
uh we might get from it some clues as to what the underlying one which he called following
6:39:08
kant the the pneumon or the no women on it's a word from the greek we might get
6:39:13
some idea of what the pneumonian is and i think his great starting point was
6:39:19
this that kant had argued that all our knowledge of material objects must come to us and
6:39:26
can come to us only through our senses and be as it were put together by our minds
6:39:32
schopenhauer said well this is almost exactly right but there is one absolutely crucial exception to it which
6:39:38
amazingly can't seem to have overlooked and that is that for every individual one of us there is one unique physical
6:39:45
object in the world which we we know in the way kant says we know physical objects but we also know
6:39:52
in a radically and entirely different way namely directly from inside and that is
6:39:58
ourselves our own bodies our own persons they are physical objects in the way
6:40:03
that any other physical object is a physical object and they can be seen and touched and heard and known in all the
6:40:09
ways that other physical objects are known but each one of us in addition to that has immediate non-sensory knowledge
6:40:17
of this one physical object from inside directly and
6:40:22
schopenhauer thought that this knowledge of a physical object from inside might
6:40:28
provide us with the key to the inner nature of things that's what he thought personally i think that if one starts
6:40:34
with kant's premises everyone must accept cancer gnosticism i don't think there's any way of getting out of it but
6:40:41
uh certainly you're quite right of course that that is what schopenhauer thought that that there was an access
6:40:47
through the uh through the body the only difficulty is it seems to me that our idea of even our
6:40:54
idea of an ultimate reality is belongs on those premises to the world
6:40:59
of phenomena and there's no way outside the circle and beyond the simply lies um
6:41:05
silence as wittgenstein was to say in the track thetas and um
6:41:11
however it's quite perfectly true that chirping however thought there was a hint given through our experience of our
6:41:17
bodies yes i would want to defend schopenhauer up to this point in the argument because he makes the point that
6:41:23
the knowledge that we have of ourselves directly from inside is not knowledge of kant's thing in itself
6:41:31
and there are two or three very important reasons why it's not one is that the knowledge we have from
6:41:36
ourselves from inside is still only a kind of superficial knowledge
6:41:41
uh decades in advance of freud he argued very specifically and at length that
6:41:47
most of our own inner life and motivation and so on is unknown to us
6:41:53
that our actions and our speech and our decisions are for the most part unconsciously motivated so that in a
6:42:00
very important sense we don't even know our full inner selves
6:42:06
another reason why he thought it wasn't knowledge of kant's thing in itself is that it exists in the dimension of time
6:42:13
though it doesn't exist in the dimension of space and time can be a characteristic only of this this world
6:42:19
of ours and there was a third reason which i think is worth mentioning and it's this
6:42:24
uh schopenhauer argued that all knowledge must be of a dual form subject and object noah
6:42:32
and known observer and observed that for there to be any knowledge at all of anything you must have something that's
6:42:39
grasped and something that's grasping it and this
6:42:44
differentiation can for reasons that we were giving only a few minutes ago in a different context differentiation can
6:42:51
only exist within this phenomenal world this world of experience and therefore
6:42:56
it's only in this world that there can be knowledge or can be consciousness
6:43:02
yes that uh schopenhauer anticipated freud in remarkable ways is perfectly true and
6:43:09
helps to show the importance and of schopenhauer in the history of thought i
6:43:15
think but of course it's it's also true i think that all our ideas of these
6:43:20
infra conscious the idea that there is an infra conscious that all belongs to the phenomenal world and um
6:43:28
there we are i mean khan supremacy is guns conclusion
6:43:34
we must start to say something about how he how he did point across the gulf as it
6:43:39
were towards the newman he thought that that there was something about this inner
6:43:45
experience of ours that gave us a clue didn't he as to what the
6:43:50
ultimate nature of things outside this world is can you take up the story
6:43:56
i'd say that for example that my bodily movements the schopenhauer would be um
6:44:01
expressions of desire or he he would say use the word will
6:44:07
perhaps unfortunately but um one might use force or energy but any rate
6:44:14
the if i move my arm i will to move my arm for schopenhauer is later for
6:44:20
wittgenstein there's no entity called a will that is distinct from the movement of the arm and causes
6:44:27
it but the volition is the inside as it were of the movement and the physical
6:44:33
movement is the outside not trying to deny that there is some inside
6:44:39
and uh if we consider that and as you say the unconscious motivation that lies
6:44:44
behind the good deal of our actions we can anyway get the idea of a reality
6:44:51
as a kind of infra-conscious below conscious drive
6:44:56
um that schopenhauer called will and that perhaps some better name can be
6:45:01
given to us force or energy something of that kind but that the um we have that hint as to
6:45:09
the nature of the ultimate reality as an unconscious striving or striving for existence for life for self-assession
6:45:17
or whatever you can describe it in various ways of course yes he thought didn't he that if we
6:45:23
analyze this world of experience the world of science if you like the world of common sense
6:45:29
uh which does consist for the most part of matter in motion and most of it is
6:45:35
matter in colossal amounts i mean galaxies and solar systems and so on
6:45:40
traveling through the cosmos at gigantic speeds approaching that of light
6:45:45
so the whole material universe consists of matter in motion
6:45:52
to a degree that so to speak defies our imagination to really conceptualize it
6:45:58
and he argued i mean he there was steps in the argument that we haven't time to go through but he argued following on
6:46:04
from kant that al what is ultimate in all this must be energy he argued that
6:46:10
mata is as it were instantiated energy that a physical object is a space filled
6:46:17
with force that ultimately all matter must be transmutable into energy and it's very striking i think that that
6:46:24
particular doctrine of his has been entirely borne out by 20th century science when the physicists in our
6:46:30
century arrived at this conclusion they thought they were propounding something revolutionary and incredible but in fact
6:46:37
kant and schopenhauer arrived at this conclusion over 100 years before them by pure
6:46:43
rational reasoning of it out from ordinary experience yes when one's talking about
6:46:50
theoretical physics one has to remember that so many physicists are sometimes
6:46:57
loath to say that the terms such as energy and so on
6:47:03
denote any reality aren't they that they're of use within the framework of
6:47:09
theoretical uh physics but that it can't be taken that there's some kind of metaphysical reality called energy or so
6:47:16
on but i i i i can quite see the point of substituting energy for chauvinis will
6:47:23
industry well you're attributing to me a step i don't quite take i mean the the the i'm glad yes
6:47:29
[Laughter] i mean what i wanted to say was this schopenhauer argues that what is
6:47:35
ultimate in this world of phenomena in this world of experience is energy yes and at the scientific level in speaking
6:47:42
from the standpoint of our end day he can be said to have been remarkably pre-violent about that to have been
6:47:48
correct now he says that what the the metaphysical the underlying
6:47:54
pneumonian is whatever manifests itself as this energy
6:48:00
and throughout the cosmos i mean in the stars on the solar system in animals in trees in falling stones in ourselves in
6:48:09
everything it's the unconscious energy that forms us in the womb that makes our organs
6:48:14
work while we sleep and so on and i understand him as saying that the nearest we come to getting any
6:48:20
glimmering of what that is in experience is the experience we have inside
6:48:27
ourselves of the energy the go the force the will to exist the will to survive
6:48:34
that somehow ultimate and irreducible push or drive which is
6:48:40
underlying to everything else yes but then of course jordan wasn't indifferent to the ultimate to the underlying
6:48:46
reality was he i mean yeah he adopted quite definite attitudes and negative
6:48:52
attitudes [Music] towards it just valuing it and
6:48:58
energy is such a a neutral word that it i mean it's hard to say whether one
6:49:04
approves energy or disapproves of energy likes energy or doesn't like energy it's
6:49:09
very difficult to say but as certainly as we're both very well aware i mean
6:49:15
had a very definite attitude towards the ultimate reality and its manifestations
6:49:20
well i think it would have been better if he'd used the word energy because he decided to give the term the name will
6:49:27
to this metaphysical reality and i think that's misled people ever since because
6:49:32
we can't help associating the idea of a personality with a will or the idea of
6:49:38
an aim with a will when schopenhauer himself reiterates at different points in his writings that he
6:49:44
doesn't mean that that in his sense of the word will everything has a will a dead star or a stone has as much will
6:49:52
as you or i that it is simply the metaphysical substratum as it were
6:49:58
in everything that it's not personal not alive not organic
6:50:03
not uh has no aim and so on i think it's misled people an an impersonal word like
6:50:10
energy would have been very much better in my opinion well i think you're quite right on that particular point
6:50:16
my my own point that i was hinting at was that as um schopenhauer looked on
6:50:22
the ultimate reality as perfectly revolting and the suppose is willing to speak of it on occasion even in moral
6:50:27
terms is wicked um i mean one wouldn't naturally be led to think of energy as as
6:50:35
revolting or as not revolting least i wouldn't and certainly not as wicked and so
6:50:42
that's what i meant that he has this definite um attitude towards the ultimate reason and towards its
6:50:48
manifestation of course this world empirical world but now perhaps we can as it were change our attack a little
6:50:54
and confront that head-on up to this point in our discussion we've been sketching what schopenhauer's picture
6:51:01
yes of reality was what he thought the overall picture was
6:51:06
now let's talk about his attitude towards it he thought that the world was an appalling place a terrible place he
6:51:13
thought it was full of injustice disease repression that the hospitals and prisons of the
6:51:18
world were full of people going through the most appalling sufferings and tortures that nature was read in tooth
6:51:24
and claw that in every hour of every day thousands upon thousands of animals are
6:51:29
tearing each other to pieces alive and devouring each other alive and that the whole
6:51:35
thing is a sort of appalling nightmare it's an incredible vision and it's expressed in prose of such
6:51:42
dramatic power that no one who's ever read it is likely to forget it but that was his view wasn't it of the way things
6:51:49
are and therefore that the underlying metaphysical reality
6:51:54
must be such as to express itself in these terms and must therefore be
6:51:59
something terrible something nightmarish that's why he is renowned quite rightly for being a
6:52:05
pessimist the pessimist above all philosophers the bleak black view of reality of course he
6:52:12
didn't leave it there did he i mean he had some suggested some ways out the temporary way through aesthetic
6:52:20
contemplation through art through the creation of art and through the appreciation of art which stills desire
6:52:27
and selfishness and um longing and hostility and conflict uh
6:52:33
for the time being at the narrator this one can go into a an art gallery and
6:52:38
come and look at the pictures and without desiring anything but then of course one
6:52:44
comes out and runs into a cafe or a pub and desire need and desire reassert
6:52:50
themselves but it's a temporary way out uh i i think it was a mistake for chopin
6:52:56
to bring in the um that point the platonic ideas as intermediate between the ultimate
6:53:03
reality and the work of art because i don't see this much place in his system
6:53:08
but he's quite right in making a distinction between the aesthetic attitude towards things
6:53:15
and the attitude of trying to appropriate them and and use them for one's own
6:53:21
advantage is quite true there there is a temporary way out yes you're making the point that he
6:53:28
thought that the aesthetic attitude was disinterested yes that normally if i see
6:53:33
a plate of food i think in terms of eating it this is something for my own sustenance or to satisfy my lusts or
6:53:39
desires or greed or just simply hunger or whatever it might be whereas if i see
6:53:45
a dutch painting of a plate of food i don't see it in that light at all i see it as an entirely sort of impersonal
6:53:52
disinterested way and then i'm conscious of its presence or absence of aesthetic
6:53:57
qualities yes beauty or lack of beauty it may be but but it's a quite different way of looking at things
6:54:04
yes one one point that i think is worth drawing attention to in schopenhauer's aesthetic is that
6:54:10
he did think that the arts provided us with a special way of
6:54:15
knowing things and by that very token he did not regard them as a means of expression
6:54:23
if i produced a work of art my what i'm doing primarily according to schopenhauer isn't expressing my
6:54:30
emotions or giving expression to my feelings it's expressing insight or knowledge
6:54:36
into something about the way things are i think one can give meaning to that is in the um the idea that was going around
6:54:43
when i was undergraduate in the 20s i mean propagated largely by clive bell a
6:54:49
significant form one might put that instead of the platonic ideas something like that i think it's as to the idea of
6:54:55
truth in art i think it's a very interesting subject and a difficult subject and i've never really made up my
6:55:03
mind um about it as to the truth
6:55:09
in art um i think one must have though it's rather off the point um an
6:55:17
analogical view of truth in which truth according to the context can be understood in different ways as
6:55:23
correspondence in one context but not i think in in art it wouldn't take it would be
6:55:28
another kind of truth and that has to be examined i think it's a perfectly respectable line of thought certainly
6:55:35
and one well worth pursuing um and certainly
6:55:40
making a critical remark about sherman has used the platonic ideas i didn't mean to say that they i didn't think
6:55:47
there was anything in his view about because i do i think it's very well worth considering certainly and it's had an enormous appeal to many great artists
6:55:54
certainly who obviously therefore thought that it corresponded to their conception yeah that's what it was they
6:55:59
were doing undoubtedly yes undoubtedly i think we must move on now to the consideration of schopenhauer's morals
6:56:07
what would you say was the place for morality or ethics in a a world as
6:56:13
painted by schopenhauer for as you know
6:56:19
bernard insists that as there's one ultima ultimate reality and
6:56:25
each one of us is identical with that one ultimate reality therefore in some
6:56:30
sense we're all one ultimately and he uses that for advocating um
6:56:37
compassion sympathy um agape love is distinct from erotic
6:56:43
love i mean sitting from arrows well all the more power to his elbow i
6:56:50
mean necessarily noble that he should uphold that idea of compassion and so on it's difficult to see how each one of us
6:56:57
is an embodiment of that horrible reality that there was much room for
6:57:03
mutual love i mean the conflict will be more like it i should have thought but any rate it it certainly
6:57:09
undoubtedly values love against hatred and compassion rather than cruelty and so on
6:57:15
i certainly don't want to question those valuations of chopin far from it but ultimately of course as where all the
6:57:22
ultimate one will and the will of something horrible the ultimate ideal can only be turning against the ultimate
6:57:29
reality i'd like to keep these two notions separate uh for the moment and before we move on to his idea of turning
6:57:36
against reality i'd like just to say a little more about the about his view of morals and ethics because
6:57:43
it was in a sense applied metaphysics in a rather unusual sense for a philosopher
6:57:49
he had as you say this metaphysical view that we were all ultimately
6:57:54
one and again that is in common with some religions and therefore that that in
6:58:01
doing you an injury i am in some significant ultimate sense injuring myself
6:58:07
and that my ultimate oneness with you is really the basis of morality the basis
6:58:12
of compassion the basis of empathy it's why i should behave towards you in morally approved ways and not behave
6:58:20
towards you in aggressive ways and you were quite right to say that there's an apparent conflict between
6:58:26
uh regarding the metaphysical the ultimate metaphysical reality is awful
6:58:32
and evil and nightmarish in the way we were talking about a few moments ago and regarding it in this context as the
6:58:38
basis of compassion empathy and morality in general i would like at this point to
6:58:44
say that that uh the famous fact value distinction applies as much to schopenhauer in my
6:58:51
opinion as it does to anyone else that is to say that you can accept his view
6:58:57
or a great deal of his view about how things are about what reality is
6:59:03
without accepting his evaluation of it or taking up his stance towards it
6:59:09
and i say that with feeling because in fact it it i'm an example i i think of this i mean i do regard very large parts
6:59:17
of sherpanhar's philosophy by no means all of it but large parts of it i regard as being valid and is having enormously
6:59:25
rare and important and genuinely deep insights and i think it casts great illumination
6:59:31
but i'm not a pessimist in chopin has sense at all in other words i accept his picture of the way things are to an
6:59:38
important degree but i don't at all take up his view of it all as being a nightmare or
6:59:45
you know whatever it may be so i would go along with the with the ethics of schopenhauer in fact
6:59:51
i think his ethics is very well funded um and wouldn't want to as it were keep
6:59:57
that part of his philosophy with which it's in conflict as you know a good many philosophers now
7:00:03
question the fact value distinction i wouldn't wish to i think it has a in
7:00:08
indispensable use myself because we must distinguish for example between the way in which people behave and the way in
7:00:15
which they ought or not to behave they do propositions uh different types that's perfectly obvious
7:00:21
on the other hand i don't think myself that one can have any interpretation of the world that doesn't contain value
7:00:27
judgments failure judgments are important of significance and so on and any more than you can have a history
7:00:33
that goes beyond mere um chronology and that is really tells a
7:00:38
significant coherent story you can have you can't have a history without without value judgments i don't believe
7:00:45
in value through free history or value-free metaphysics so i i would be although i'm
7:00:53
willing to accept some distinction um i'd be very careful about um applying it
7:01:00
myself and simply saying well we can have this interpretation of the world on the one hand which is value-free and
7:01:07
then the set of valuations on the other because i don't think things work out in quite that way you know no i don't think
7:01:14
they work out in quite that way either um i was merely making the point that you could share you could have a lot of
7:01:21
chopin and i was always careful not to say all but only a lot of schopenhauer's
7:01:26
view of the way things are without sharing his value judgments i would have other judgments and i would
7:01:33
entirely agree with you that you can't have a view with no value judgments i think that's i think that's absolutely
7:01:39
correct um but now uh let us uh move on as it were to the final stage of
7:01:45
schopenhauer's philosophy when he taking his value judgment seeing that reality in all its manifest or in most
7:01:52
of its manifestations is an evil a frightening a nightmarish thing the final step in
7:01:59
his philosophy which some have embraced and others have found impossible even to understand sometimes is he says
7:02:06
we must reject this ultimately we must reject reality we must deny
7:02:12
reality the famous denial of the will can you perhaps try and explain a little
7:02:18
more about what's involved in that concept well i'd say that um if you turn yeah
7:02:23
well because he he entirely approved of the uh asceticism
7:02:29
self-mortification and so on that one can find in in several of the world religions advocated and enraged and
7:02:35
practiced in the past and um that he thought that that was
7:02:42
constituted a stage on the way towards a kind of final rejection of the will i don't quite know what form that would
7:02:49
take but it would take the for i suppose the form of an entry into a buddhist nirvana
7:02:54
interpreted as nothingness well schopenhauer would say may possibly have qualities of which we
7:03:01
know nothing and can know nothing but as far as we're concerned to turn against the
7:03:06
the the ultimate reality as we form a conception of it is to turn to um
7:03:11
nothingness the non-existence that's why i would say that in spite of all the uh
7:03:17
real resemblances between
7:03:22
say christianity buddhism and schopenhauer's philosophy
7:03:29
there is a fundamental difference between his attitude and say that of the
7:03:35
christian the muslim and the orthodox jew because it as they
7:03:41
believe in in god they certainly wouldn't regard it as desirable that one should
7:03:48
chuck a guard overboard or deny the ultimate reality in that sense so
7:03:55
there it seems to me there is a there is a gulf but but but more important because
7:04:01
people who might sweep that aside and say well i'm neither a christian nor a muslim nor a jew but um
7:04:07
even in terms of schopenhauer's own philosophy i don't see how it's possible to turn against the will because it's
7:04:12
the will that has to deny itself i am the will and if this ultimate reality is
7:04:18
going to deny it how can it deny itself
7:04:24
in and through me it can't produce nothingness exactly i don't see how i i i find it very the more i think about
7:04:31
it the more difficult i find to to envisage that ultimate uh rejection
7:04:36
of the will is taking place when the will itself has got to do it let us before we finish this discussion i'd
7:04:42
like us to say a word or two about schopenhauer's influence on other people he's had enormous influence on creative
7:04:48
artists and i referred to that i didn't name any but one might name
7:04:53
wagner an enormous influence to gain an enormous influence in fact lots of major
7:04:59
novelists of the last 100 years conrad thomas hardy proust
7:05:05
thomas mann but perhaps in a discussion which is about philosophy what we ought to concentrate on
7:05:11
is not that so much as his influence on other major thinkers and i think three stand out in
7:05:18
importance nietzsche freud and wittgenstein as having in
7:05:23
chronological order as having been very obviously and strikingly influenced by schopenhauer between his day and ours
7:05:31
could you perhaps say something about his influence on nietzsche as you know nietzsche
7:05:37
regarded uh schopenhauer as an educator and his early work as schopenhauer's
7:05:43
educator um indicates i think that he thought of schopenhauer as a man who wasn't content
7:05:50
with the superficial view of things but looked underneath and wasn't afraid to look the world in history in in the face
7:05:57
and didn't try and gloss over everything as leibniz did was talk about the best of all possible worlds but
7:06:05
really looked the world in the face and um
7:06:10
it was therefore a man of mental integrity it also entirely agreed with schopenhauer's
7:06:16
subordination of intellect to will in its first instance the servant of the will
7:06:21
and um also i think he regarded chopin has a man of great independence of character
7:06:28
who didn't uh allow himself to be his views to be dictated by society or but thought them
7:06:34
out or by his predecessors for the matter of that or other philosophers but thought them out for himself
7:06:40
he i think but he came of course to criticize as you know uh schopenhauer in the course of time
7:06:47
for his turning away from life and uh although it's been said of nietzsche by professor crane brinton
7:06:53
that the great yay sayer spent most of his life saying no um nietzsche um did officially uphold the
7:07:01
affirming of the world as it is and um
7:07:06
in a way i i sympathize with nietzsche because i think if the world is as chopin how sad it is then the best thing
7:07:12
is to try and um alter it for the better i don't say the nietzsche um
7:07:18
well he thought i mean i wouldn't agree with nietzsche's idea of what would be for the better but
7:07:23
um i i there i i do agree with nietzsche but on the other hand he never ceased to
7:07:28
admire chopin her and revere him as a man who'd set him on the right path away
7:07:34
from convention it was a great question i think well i think we must now turn finally to
7:07:40
the latest of the great thinkers who was directly influenced by schopenhauer namely wittgenstein and perhaps you'd
7:07:47
like to conclude this discussion by uh saying a little about scherpenhauer's influence on wittgenstein thank you
7:07:53
yes well then because that's quite clear isn't it i mean from the preparation the material preparatory to
7:08:00
the tractators in the notebooks and in the other manuscripts the
7:08:05
debt of wittgenstein to schopenhauer is made quite clear and in the tractators
7:08:10
itself this idea to which you referred earlier in our conversation of the um correlation between the subject and
7:08:19
my world that is strong in in wittgenstein the
7:08:25
that this i and my world and that the eye the epistemological subject is as it
7:08:31
were the boundary of my world it's not an object in my world and because if i try to think of myself then there's the
7:08:37
eye that's trying to think of myself but it's on the borderline as it were of the world that comes straight out of
7:08:43
shopenha then the famous saying in the tractatus that if all the problems of science were onset the problems of life
7:08:51
wouldn't have been touched that also really comes from schopenhauer i think and it's also
7:08:57
noteworthy that in the tractatus wittgenstein makes a distinction between the will is the bearer of ethics of
7:09:04
which he says nothing can really be said that's the metaphenominal will and the will as
7:09:10
a phenomenon which is really the forms part of the subject matter of
7:09:16
psychology rather than a philosophy for for the author of the tractators and um
7:09:23
therefore there is that distinction between the metaphysical will i think the
7:09:28
metaphenominal will and the phenomenal will which also can be um traced i think
7:09:34
to schopenhauer the i should say that wittgenstein
7:09:40
the course of time became less and less chopin harian um in the sense that he became less and
7:09:45
less addicted to um forming a system whereas as you said much earlier schopenhauer was certainly a system
7:09:52
builder there is a kind of embryo system in the trachtas but there's very little as we
7:09:58
all know in the later writings of wittgenstein and um but still he undoubtedly was
7:10:04
strongly influenced by chopin in fact he's about the only major philosopher of the past uh it was
7:10:11
no sense contemporary that wittgenstein had really read and studied and digested at all i
7:10:18
think so um it shows that the influence of
7:10:24
schopenhauer by no means ended with the 19th century but as you said earlier to slip down
7:10:30
into the 20th century and is embodied in one of the most famous philosophers of
7:10:35
our century in time thank you very much professor coppelston
J. P. Stern on Nietzsche
7:10:42
there can be little doubt i think that the two 19th century philosophers who have had the widest influence outside
7:10:48
philosophy are marx and nietzsche in continental europe especially the
7:10:53
influence of nietzsche on philosophers since his day has been prodigious but he's also influenced creative writers
7:11:00
including some of the most eminent in the english language for instance bernard shaw w b yates and d h lawrence
7:11:07
the quality of his own prose is simply dazzling and is second to nobodies friedrich nietzsche was born in saxony
7:11:14
in 1844 he had an academic career of extraordinary brilliance as a classic
7:11:19
scholar and became a full professor in his mid-twenties an almost unheard-of thing
7:11:25
but then he threw over his university career went into isolation and became a philosopher
7:11:31
for 16 years he poured out his writings mostly either short books or books of
7:11:36
essays and aphorisms some of the best known titles are the birth of tragedy
7:11:42
human all too human the gay science beyond good and evil and most famous of
7:11:47
all thus spoke zarathustra at first he was deeply influenced by the ideas of schopenhauer and wagner but he
7:11:54
rebelled against both and went on to produce some notorious anti-wagner polemics
7:12:00
until the last four years of his creative life he made no attempt to build a system of any kind but then he
7:12:07
began to think of drawing all his main themes together into one single comprehensive work first to be called
7:12:14
the will to power then the revaluation of all values but it was not to be
7:12:20
always plagued by ill health in january 1889 he collapsed into mental illness a
7:12:25
condition almost certainly caused by tertiary syphilis and he was helplessly insane until his death in 1900
7:12:34
with me to discuss his work is j.p stern professor of german in the university of london and author of one of the best
7:12:41
known of the many books on nietzsche professor stern i think one can say that nietzsche was the first philosopher
7:12:47
really to face up to western man's loss of faith in religion loss of belief in
7:12:53
god or in the existence of any world outside this one and if there's no god and no
7:12:59
transcendental world then all values all truth rationality standards of any kind
7:13:06
are not given to man from some agency outside himself but are created by man
7:13:12
presumably for his own needs we choose our values or at least we create our
7:13:18
values now this is an extraordinary disruptive and disturbing thing to
7:13:24
confront and nietzsche knew that can we start the story from there yes i think that this is a perfectly fair way of
7:13:31
starting in addition to what you said about his life i think one might mention that he
7:13:36
was a son of the man's that he himself had his father was a was a minister
7:13:44
of the lutheran church and therefore his attack on christianity is not a neutral not a disinterested
7:13:52
not a pacific thing at all but is violent dramatic melodramatic in many
7:13:57
ways it's an attack on christianity rather than on christ and i think the point that you made that
7:14:04
he envisages 19th century man to have to stand on his own feet without the
7:14:11
support of faith or dogma of any kind is central as a central kind of starting
7:14:16
point to his philosophy i think we want to see him as somebody who does not simply profess a flat kind
7:14:25
of atheism but who is personally intimately involved in the denial of
7:14:31
divine justice and divine mercy and all that but this nietzschean starting point did
7:14:38
launch him didn't it into a re-evaluation of all values yes to use the title of his book i mean one thing
7:14:44
he was saying was that uh in a way we are basing our lives on false premises
7:14:49
because we adopt attitudes and values and standards which when we actually examine the premises of them we reject
7:14:57
those premises what he believed in what he tried to
7:15:03
show was that the whole edifice both of christian values and of idealism which
7:15:10
he saw derivative from those values was false had to be thrown over and
7:15:15
something else to be put in instead the question as to what was to be put in instead is not quite so simple but that
7:15:21
was the basic premise from which he began and that i think makes for the melodrama
7:15:26
the extraordinary melodrama of the person of the style of the whole phenomenon of nature
7:15:32
now this revaluation of all values is of course a colossal task and i think it'll make our discussion of it clearer if we
7:15:40
divide our consideration of it up a little bit yes there are four main
7:15:45
traditions within western civilization to which nietzsche addressed himself in which he attacked
7:15:51
the tradition of christian morality the tradition of secular morality
7:15:57
the herd values as he called them the ordinary morality of the mass of mankind
7:16:03
and some at least of the traditions deriving from ancient
7:16:12
can you say a little bit more about his fundamental criticism of christian values well i
7:16:18
think to say to start with on the christian i think the attack is a very simple one a very
7:16:23
straightforward one all the positive values of christianity turning around
7:16:29
turning the other cheek loving your neighbor as you love yourself having compassion for those
7:16:35
suffering all these are ruled out of court now not absolutely because as we
7:16:41
shall see later i think i want to make that point very clearly nietzsche is constantly making special rules for
7:16:47
special people and he is very much against the notion of generalizing simply rules in the in
7:16:53
the way in which kant had done in the categorical imperative so yes the first thing then is the
7:16:59
attack on not on christ but on christianity as really furthering the
7:17:04
underdog furthering the person who cannot stand on his own feet and requires compassion requires pity
7:17:11
requires uh illicitly requires sympathy from the outside but why was he against
7:17:16
compassion and against pity why did he despise those so much he's not against
7:17:22
them he does not despise them when they come from the strong person what he despises is the support of the weak
7:17:28
person from outside himself whatever that source is the outside source may be whether it's another person his
7:17:34
compassion or rules or regulations laws or whatever and the reason for being against this
7:17:40
was what the reason for being against it was his fundamental appeal is to authenticity to self-hood to the elo
7:17:48
vital to the life within the person lived to the full yeah now what about his criticism of secular morality i mean
7:17:56
the great moral philosophers like can't or in his own day the utilitarians and so on that wasn't christian morality
7:18:03
quite but he was against that too yeah why i think the main reason there is this that all systems of secular
7:18:10
moralities are based on an abstraction from the individual case they're based
7:18:16
on an appeal to a generality for nietzsche the word general is the same as common and by common he means
7:18:23
common in the nasty sense of the word and therefore in a sense all rules and regulations one might almost go as far
7:18:29
as saying all laws are for him matters for the common herd and no more
7:18:34
and now we're of course already on the third point that you made the point about the common herd yeah he's most
7:18:40
emphatically not a democratic philosopher he's a philosopher of the great and the noble people the heroic
7:18:48
kind of philosophy and therefore for him the appeal of democratic ideology is
7:18:55
very very low indeed he thought that the the the noble man the great man the hero
7:19:01
should be a law unto himself and shouldn't be hamstrung precisely petty rules and regulations
7:19:08
and so on that's the best phrase you can use a law unto himself it's not
7:19:13
the sentence he used but it's very very precise what he meant now what about the last of the four uh uh traditions that i
7:19:20
mentioned that of ancient greece it's worth remembering in this context that he did start adult life as a
7:19:26
classic scholar yes he knew about ancient greece and became
7:19:31
deeply critical didn't he have the whole tradition deriving from socrates yes but uh his uh classical work and i think
7:19:39
it's one of the most remarkable works ever written on the whole problem of tragedy uh is concerned with
7:19:45
pre-socratic greece with pre-socratic tragedy which for him is a kind of golden age and the whole thing
7:19:52
uh goes flat at the point when uh euripides aristophanes and
7:20:00
and socrates come on the scene what happens there is that strength and good
7:20:06
will and warmth and beauty are replaced by reason are replaced by rationalizing
7:20:13
things by the socratic algae bhaji he never forgave plato so to speak for
7:20:19
bringing up a hero whose main qualities are those of talking everybody else into
7:20:25
the ground now this concern with the origins of culture uh which he displayed
7:20:32
in such a rich way one has to say um was all bound up with his notion that we
7:20:38
remake our that we make our values yes because if we if if human values and
7:20:45
human culture are made by us and not given to us by god or authority outside ourselves then
7:20:52
the whole question of how we get them where they come from becomes a fundamental one for him
7:20:58
doesn't it and it's also a fundamental 19th century concern the whole is concerned with origins yes and things of
7:21:05
the origin of species darwinism and so on was nietzsche influenced by darwin
7:21:10
yes well he certainly was anti-darwinian and i think the idea is that he didn't
7:21:16
really understand very clearly what the whole theory of the origin of the species came to like so many 19th
7:21:23
century figures he was always going to study physiology going to study
7:21:28
chemistry going to study physics but never got round to it so i don't think that there's an awful lot of interesting
7:21:34
things to be said about his attitude to that but i think the main point about origins is
7:21:40
that again like some philosophers like marx for instance he believes that you
7:21:46
can determine the quality of the product by the nature and quality of the origin
7:21:52
this after all is very much what freud did and i suspect that freud got it very largely from nietzsche although he does
7:21:58
isn't very ready to acknowledge it now what that means is really that the background the the genealogy of morals
7:22:07
for instance you quoted one of the titles is in fact indicative of the quality of morals now let me say i don't
7:22:14
believe this is true but i mean that is very much the 19th century view over and over again that you can determine the
7:22:21
quality of a mental product by the nature by the origin uh that is at the
7:22:27
back of it yes and we are knowing fine sometimes to call that the genetic fallacy that's true i don't want to go
7:22:33
into this i think it's very close yes you're mentioning a freud prompts another question that i wanted to put to
7:22:39
you this program of uh re-evaluating values and seeing values are something
7:22:45
that we create to meet our needs led nietzsche to a
7:22:50
psychological analysis of values in terms of both individual and
7:22:56
social media that is perfect it becomes an essentially psychological it is a way of
7:23:03
psycho or psychologizing a lot of phenomena this is perfectly correct and
7:23:08
indeed i think he was a very remarkable psychologist in many ways and he puts
7:23:14
he does not produce a system either in psychology or in anything else and in that sense he's different from freud but
7:23:22
he's very very similar in fact very much of an antecedent to freud because he places a very great deal of emphasis
7:23:28
upon the unconscious there is a myth about to the effect that freud invented the unconscious nothing
7:23:34
could be further from the truth the unconscious has been about since the end of the 18th century and nietzsche is one
7:23:40
of those who use the term and put tremendous emphasis on it but he does not have a layer theory of the self the
7:23:47
way that freud did as i say he is very very much less systematic he distrusts systems he
7:23:54
thinks there's something indecent about trying to encapsulate a human being a human psyche within a systematic account
7:24:02
another aspect of that is is his notion that that different moralities are different
7:24:08
are appropriate for different people which he certainly had didn't i mean wouldn't it be true to say well in fact
7:24:13
you have said it i think that he distrusted rules he you thought they hamstrung the strong they limited the
7:24:19
creative yes yes he does believe that individual people
7:24:25
are entitled to individual kinds of behavior and to individual
7:24:31
bits of knowledge this is the most astonishing thing and also i think in many ways very prophetic kind of thing
7:24:38
that he believed that knowledge was not absolute that the that the acquisition the pursuit of knowledge was not to be
7:24:44
taken absolutely but that a given civilization had its own particular entitlement to
7:24:51
the kind of knowledge that it could bear you see the emphasis is on it could bear
7:24:56
it he did envisage situations where knowledge would destroy the knower our
7:25:01
knowledge of nuclear fission has become a lethal threat to us
7:25:06
and that is something that nietzsche would very easily and very well have understood yes and he did in fact say so he i mean not about nuclear physics of
7:25:13
course but in about knowledge generally you see we only have really one other theory of knowledge apart from our own
7:25:20
our own is that all knowledge is worth pursuing regardless isn't it yes well the other one is the soviet idea which
7:25:26
goes on and which simply creates a a system by which knowledge is socially
7:25:31
useful and then pursued and not pursued if it's not socially useful nietzsche's view is somewhat similar to
7:25:38
this he does believe that given civilizations uh can destroy themselves
7:25:45
and the basic the ground on which all this is erected is in fact we're coming
7:25:50
back now to socrates the socratic yen for knowledge this this endless
7:25:56
this driving force which pushes us on up to this point in our discussion we've talked about nature's critical
7:26:04
enterprise this basic view that up to this point in our history the morals and values and
7:26:11
standards of western men have all been historically based on belief in a god or
7:26:16
in gods who gave us these values gave us these moral standards and so on and would judge us by our failure to live up
7:26:24
to the more success in living out to them and so on now he comes along he says we've lost belief in god we've lost
7:26:31
belief in religion that means we've lost belief in the whole foundation of our value system and if we're to have a
7:26:38
valid value system we've got to reevaluate it and refund it from the
7:26:43
bottom up and we've not we've talked of some of the various critiques individual critiques into
7:26:49
which this led him i now want us to move on from this to the next stage of the discussion in a sense it's the obvious
7:26:56
question to ask what were his positive values having as it were swept everything away on a
7:27:03
colossal scale what is he now advocating that we put in its place well
7:27:09
the answer to that is a very simple and a very complicated one both at the same time the simple answer is be yourself at
7:27:16
the top of of everything that you are uh to to to the hilt uh
7:27:23
live your life fully live it adventurously um and all the other things which later
7:27:28
on come under the under the heading of elon vital that in the human sphere i mean that essentially the be thou
7:27:36
thyself is the major premise from which he begins since also the goal to to towards which ethics
7:27:43
ought ought to the goal uh towards which ethics ought
7:27:49
to be directed um now you may ask of course if everybody is himself and himself alone how is this to be done uh
7:27:57
in a wider sphere how is it to be done in a political system and so on the answers to that question are i'm afraid
7:28:03
very unsatisfactory as far as he's concerned as indeed his whole attitude towards social questions never does get
7:28:11
very far now i said also that this is very very complicated precisely for this reason
7:28:17
because it makes living together living together in some kind of harmony
7:28:23
extremely difficult if you add to this the view that laws are after all there
7:28:29
simply to make easy make things easy for the weak person you can see there's not
7:28:34
very much purchase to be got out of that either so it is on the face of it a
7:28:39
simple system but um basically i think there is a great deal of difficulty facing anyone
7:28:47
who is going to put this forward in a sense i think we can say that some of the more uh some of the fascist uh
7:28:55
politics earlier of of the early part of the century is based to some extent among the intellectuals at any rate on
7:29:02
this view that you must create your own values um well it hasn't got us very far as you
7:29:08
can see but this notion that you must say as he put it say yes to life yes a firm life yes be
7:29:14
untrammeled to the top of your bent uninhibited uh also led him to the view that that of
7:29:20
course this is going to lead you into conflict with other people but you must simply sweep them aside you must sweep
7:29:26
away the weak and the unable and all those who as it were get in your way yes
7:29:32
that of course is absolutely flat head-on in conflict with christian morality yes it has but then you see
7:29:39
you've only mentioned one half of it the other part of it is you must also conquer all that is comfortable or that
7:29:47
is cowardly or that is less than adventurous within yourself and if
7:29:52
you've done that that is the view that he puts forward in zarathustra for instance if you've done that you won't
7:29:59
really want to be so very aggressive towards the others you will have some understanding of their weaknesses though
7:30:05
the understanding of the positive the tolerant understanding of weaknesses is not precisely uh nietzsche's very strong
7:30:12
what he's most famous for i mean people of course have always been shocked by his saying this and they
7:30:18
thought that what he was advocating was contrary to moral standards and so on yes but his point of course was that
7:30:25
that in fact moral standards ought to be derived from life ought to be subordinate to life yes that
7:30:32
our notions of truth and rationality and all the rest ought to derive from life
7:30:38
assertions or from the great man yes from the great man and by the great man he meant as i
7:30:43
already mentioned goethe would be one um napoleon would be another sometimes
7:30:49
luther sometimes even some of the great borja popes would figure as that and
7:30:54
sometimes even socrates would because he had the strength of mind to
7:30:59
carry through his own project but this supremacy of life assertion and self-assertion means that even truth
7:31:06
truth itself must be subjugated absolutely if there are truths that would damage us that in other words
7:31:12
would damage our lives then we don't want to yes you see we're back again at the
7:31:17
question of the entitlement to truth or of at what he once called the hygiene of
7:31:24
knowledge there ought to be some kind of hygiene that would tell us what kind of
7:31:30
knowledge we may face and what kind of knowledge we should reject and you're quite right
7:31:36
that truth itself in that way is subjected to this kind of embargo to
7:31:41
this kind of to this kind of sanction that he puts forward well one sees absolutely how this is flat contrary to
7:31:48
all moralities that have actually existed would it be true to say that nietzsche's defense if he deigned to
7:31:55
defend himself against criticism would have been to say something like this but look the whole of civilization humanity
7:32:02
itself if you like the whole evolutionary process has consisted of the strong eliminating
7:32:09
the weak the able eliminating the unable the intelligent eliminating the stupid and it's only because these processes
7:32:16
have gone on perpetually over millions of years that we have any civilization at all that we have any humanity at all
7:32:23
these things have created yes value yes i think that is precisely what he says
7:32:28
and uh what you would say on number of occasions different contexts and his worry about the future is precisely that
7:32:34
this kind of thing will not go on that the democratic spirit the spirit of the
7:32:39
plebs of the of the rebelment will take over and will annihilate
7:32:45
all these values but it will put into reverse the very process that has actually created civilization out of
7:32:53
barbarians but in addition to that i think we have to bear in mind that he has a view of history which is rather
7:33:00
different from the view on which your analysis was based uh he sees history as
7:33:06
repeating itself now what that means we shall talk about that a little later but what it essentially means is this that
7:33:13
any historical situation can create
7:33:18
and absorb and uh make use of uh the highest that man is capable of creating
7:33:26
there aren't any privileged situations there are no privileged eras
7:33:31
uh and and therefore any era that
7:33:36
sees itself as capable of fully understanding or fully creating
7:33:42
these values should be should allow should be allowed to do that and the trouble is that late 19th
7:33:48
century the early 20th century may very well be what he calls areas of decadence in which this strength cannot be fully
7:33:56
realized now your mention of his doctrine that history repeats itself uh brings me to what i would like to think
7:34:03
of as the next stage in our discussion um when one comes to regard nietzsche's later work
7:34:09
there are four big themes in it and again i think for clarity's sake it will help if we take them one at a time
7:34:16
one is uh what you might summarize under the phrase the will to power a phrase
7:34:22
which he has popularized one is the ubermensch or translated as the
7:34:28
superman again an invention of his that's entered our language
7:34:33
one is this dr new mention of the eternal recurrence of time and the fourth i would say is his notion
7:34:40
of the aesthetic uh understanding of life now let's deal with those in order let's
7:34:47
cut let's talk first about the will to power which at one time he was going to give as a title to the summation of his
7:34:53
life's work yes what was this notion of his the will to power well he takes the
7:34:58
notion the will from your own special philosopher schopenhauer of course and he reverses
7:35:04
the the evaluation of that where shopping regarded the will as the source of all evil in the world and as the
7:35:12
source of man's unhappiness he regards it as the strength of uh
7:35:18
of man's man's strength the source of man's strength and the um the
7:35:24
cultivation uh the permission to the will to enact what it
7:35:31
can enact is part of a healthy culture now uh the the difficulty there i think
7:35:38
is that this obviously brings you in conflict
7:35:44
with other people and therefore at this stage the will to power becomes becomes a will to self-assertion uh will to use
7:35:51
user patient of the other uh but that's not all there is to the will i think it's to be emphasized not
7:35:57
over emphasized as some some critics have done but to be emphasized that the
7:36:02
will to power also turns itself inward that is to say it destroys within the
7:36:08
self or that is weak or that is comfortable or that is uh simply um
7:36:17
yes part of a a man's self-indulgence a kind of drastic bringing of oneself up
7:36:24
to the mark up to up to the mark which one has created oneself and this is the difference
7:36:30
yes that's right yes yes well now let's move on then to the the next of the four main
7:36:36
themes of his later words the superman now everybody knows the word superman and it was in fact nietzsche who
7:36:41
invented it it's been a very much misunderstood concept people have associated it with the blonde beast of
7:36:49
hitlerian mythology and nazi caricature because that's not what he meant at all
7:36:54
i think that is not what he meant at all um i think the superman is the man
7:37:02
the production i mean who can be produced by any civilization you remember i said that any
7:37:08
any era is capable of bringing forth the maximum values that men are capable of
7:37:15
superman is the man who lives all that the will to power will secure
7:37:21
for him lives it to the full is capable of uh repeating his own
7:37:29
willing ad infinitum we're already arriving at the doctrine at that most
7:37:35
controversial of all the things the most uh bizarre if you like of these views the uh the eternal recurrence yes don't
7:37:42
let's get there yet because i want to unpack this notion of the superman yes
7:37:47
which has played such an enormous role in the thought in the last 100 years and been so abused and misused by the nazis
7:37:55
for example um wouldn't it be truer to say that what nietzsche was actually trying to get at
7:38:01
was the notion of an unrepressed man yes if you like the freudian sense yes a man
7:38:06
who has reevaluated his values yes who is not living his life according to false values who is being to the top of
7:38:14
his best in an uninhibited untrammeled free spirit way isn't that rather yes i
7:38:21
think that is so and but it would be a man who without as it
7:38:26
were restricting himself would naturally instinctively not do
7:38:34
any of the things that nietzsche regards as evil for instance the one category that he
7:38:41
comes out unequivocally that comes out unequivocally in his
7:38:47
system is grudgingness is what he calls resontimo is the grudgingness the grudging
7:38:54
admission of warmth the grudging admission of success and all these kind of things now
7:39:01
the superman is one who naturally does not feel any of these things you know
7:39:06
this is not a generous spirit it is a general it is a generous spirit um yes
7:39:11
and there again you see the whole notion of the christian genu general spirit is not all that far uh from nietzsche's
7:39:18
purview now let us move on to the third of our four main themes and you've touched on
7:39:23
it already this notion of the eternal recurrence now i would say that if anything of all the
7:39:29
doctrines of nature this is the hardest not just for people to understand but even to take seriously i mean on the
7:39:36
face of it he appears to be saying that the whole of history moves in epicycles
7:39:42
vast epicycles so that everything comes round again and again and again forever so that you and i have
7:39:50
actually sat in this studio having this conversation unnumberable times before
7:39:56
and we'll do so unnumbable times again now is he really saying that well he's
7:40:02
really saying that and he is trying out what might happen if you took that view
7:40:08
seriously and i think we want to say all together in our whole discussion that a
7:40:14
great deal of his thinking is of this experimental kind and by that i don't
7:40:19
mean that it's not serious i don't mean that it is not responsible i don't mean that it is trivial but i do mean that
7:40:25
here's somebody who's facing the whole of human thought and is trying to make
7:40:30
some sort of shift with almost any area in it and is trying out again and again
7:40:36
different views there's a saying of his i think a very tragic saying of his in a letter where
7:40:42
he writes i feel as though i wear a pen be a new pen a quill presumably being
7:40:49
tried out by some superior power on a bit of paper it's a very strange thing
7:40:55
to be feeling for somebody who's advocating the will to power and the superman yet i think he did genuinely
7:41:01
feel that now he does then try out this thought and it seems
7:41:06
to me not so much a theory of being not so much a theory of the cosmos it seems
7:41:12
to me a moral theory that is to say our actions
7:41:17
our willing our intentions our thoughts should be of such a superior kind of
7:41:23
such a grand kind have such generosity and grandness about them that we should
7:41:28
not flinch to and be able to be willing to repeat them
7:41:33
over and over again add nauseam ad infinitum so in other words you're really only saying yes to life yes
7:41:41
embracing life as he always says we should if you would be willing to with that over again that's what you're doing
7:41:48
now and only ever yes i think to go on very much further than that and try to
7:41:53
produce geometrical or mathematical equations in order to prove either the
7:41:58
possibility or the impossibility of these youth which has been tried has been done doesn't seem to me to be
7:42:04
terribly sensible in other words it's a huge metaphor it is a huge metaphor and
7:42:09
of course a great deal must be said about nietzsche's uses of metaphors well say
7:42:15
just something about it because it's very relevant yes i think we
7:42:21
i think we we are in the habit of taking things literally in a way
7:42:26
in which which doesn't make sense as far as a great many of his statements are
7:42:31
concerned you spoke to begin with about his grand style and i think it is an extraordinary
7:42:37
powerful effective style if i ask myself where it arrives from i think it derives
7:42:42
from a strange invention a strange discovery he seems to have made of
7:42:48
placing his discourse his language somewhere halfway between metaphor and
7:42:54
literal meaning and this is something which very very few people certainly very few german uh writers uh have done
7:43:01
before him he stands entirely on his own as far as thinking is concerned you have mentioned
7:43:06
that and we've we've seen how he attacks every tradition in the west where he
7:43:12
does find his his precursors is in the style and
7:43:18
mountain and pascal and la rochefoucault are his favorite authors and that whole
7:43:23
aphoristic style i think derives a tremendous lot from them and it's not only me saying it it's himself saying it
7:43:30
and this style which is pitched halfway between metaphor and literal statement
7:43:37
is something quite extraordinary and i think unless we understand it for what it is we are going to misread him i have
7:43:45
a quotation which i think gives a an example of what i have in mind when he
7:43:51
talked about the terrible deprivation that he felt 19th century people
7:43:57
experienced through what he called luridly the death of god he wrote as follows he says rather than cope with
7:44:04
the unbearable loneliness of their condition men will continue to seek
7:44:10
their shattered god and for his sake they will love the very serpents that
7:44:15
dwell among his ruins now you see this mixture of on the one hand conceptual
7:44:21
thinking i mean loneliness and condition are abstract terms belonging to
7:44:26
conceptual thought on the other hand you've got the serpents glistening somewhere through the ruins
7:44:33
of the shattered god well that and the refusal i think to go beyond that in
7:44:39
other words to write out the theory behind the metaphors i think essentially
7:44:44
constitutes what what he's about and it does give us the readers a problem this mix this fusion
7:44:50
of poetry and metaphor on the one hand with concepts yes hard concepts on the other
7:44:56
yes gives us a problem about how to take him and that's really implicit in what
7:45:02
you've just been saying this leads to the fourth of the fourth theorems of the later philosophy we've talked now uh
7:45:09
briefly about uh the will to power about the superman and about his doctrine of the eternal
7:45:16
recurrence of time what you've just been saying about his use of metaphor leads us to the fourth
7:45:22
of the four main themes in the later work which is his notion that life is to be understood aesthetically
7:45:29
yes and i suppose the point here is is that if there's nothing outside this world no god no transcendent realm or
7:45:36
anything then any meaning or justification that life has must be
7:45:41
meaning derived from inside itself yes so that like a work of art i mean the
7:45:46
only meaning a work of art has is what it so to speak gives itself it doesn't derive its meaning from outside
7:45:53
is it is that uh well that certainly is a very fair way of of of of coming close
7:45:58
to what he's after in the very first of his books the birth of uh the the the birth of tragedy he uses this phrase
7:46:06
three times it's only as an aesthetic phenomenon that the being of man and the world are
7:46:13
eternally justified it's a very complicated sentence and i don't think i want to go into all the details of it
7:46:19
but what he's saying essentially is this the greatness of the early greeks of the pre-socratics lay in that tragedy that
7:46:26
tragedy was a way of facing the worst aspects of human life that is
7:46:32
its transitoriness its impermanence its corruptness its
7:46:37
dependence upon forces greater than yourself and to make of these a major tale a story a wonderful tragedy and
7:46:46
this he applies in the largest in the most cosmic possible sense and he's asking as indeed i think shakespeare
7:46:52
occasionally he's asking is the whole world really to be taken seriously or is
7:46:59
it not a great game a great play some kind of drama played out by we do not
7:47:05
know who um and if there is to be a justification mind
7:47:11
you justification is the phrase he uses which is a very dicey word to use in this context because of course it's a
7:47:18
judicial phrase isn't it but if there is a justification for man being here and being what he is maybe it is simply as
7:47:26
part of this huge cosmic drama and a great deal of his thought and i think of some of his most interesting
7:47:32
and greatest thought goes precisely into rehearsing and trying to make sense of this
7:47:38
justifying this aesthetic justification of man now you're talking about the way metaphor
7:47:45
and aesthetic considerations are fused into the very substance of the thought itself and you spoke very interestingly
7:47:53
a moment or two ago about his actual style yes and the tradition to which it related
7:47:58
it in its turn has had immense influence hasn't it i instant some of the great
7:48:04
creative writers yes that he has influenced in my introduction to this program yes now
7:48:09
your particular field of expertise if i may say so is known to be comparative
7:48:15
literature it would be extremely interesting i think to end this discussion with just a word or two from
7:48:21
you about the way nietzsche and his writing and his philosophy have influenced creative
7:48:28
writers since his well simply to take the three names that you yourself mentioned wbhs is the first one
7:48:35
yates read nietzsche for the first time in a very brief little excerpt
7:48:41
translated by a man called john common of all things it seems to be a most inappropriate name
7:48:46
for a translator of nietzsche um and from 1902 onwards when he read him i
7:48:52
think there is a very clear change in the general tenor and in the attitude of
7:48:57
yates's poetry and that slightly sultry slightly sentimental uh
7:49:04
yellow roses kind of poetry of founders here creates changes very much and the
7:49:10
great poetry which is the poetry or as he him as yates himself calls it the poetry of blood and maya i think is very
7:49:17
strongly influenced by his reading of nietzsche by his attempts to grasp some of the
7:49:23
problems that we discussed earlier on with uh sure that the influence is a very very different one it is very much
7:49:30
in the biological sphere it is in the sphere of that ellen vital which i mentioned it is in the sphere of the
7:49:37
ruthless life the life that justifies itself and
7:49:42
the with d.h lawrence i think again it is the question of authenticity um now
7:49:48
the authenticity is lawrence consists it's a very different kind of authenticity from the one that nietzsche
7:49:54
had in mind in other words it's social and sexual and of course both of these are really rather minor factors in
7:50:00
nietzsche but it is certainly from nietzsche uh through his wife uh frieda
7:50:05
lawrence that he acquired some knowledge of nietzsche and that he was deeply influenced by it and a very late and i
7:50:12
think rather dreadful christ story of lawrence's seems to me to derive straight out of nietzsche's
7:50:18
psychologizing of the christ figure if we look on the continent of course pirandello
7:50:23
thomas mann um all these people not only have been very
7:50:30
strongly under his influence but they acknowledge the influence throughout
7:50:35
strindberg had a long correspondence through a common friend with nietzsche
7:50:41
and so on i think that there are immensely powerful influences but we have to bear in mind
7:50:47
that the aphoristic style the uh tremendous
7:50:53
attractiveness of the metaphors the brevity of the message and literary
7:50:58
persons don't like to read heavy books they like to read aphorisms all these play very much into nietzsche's hand
7:51:06
one last question professor stern i don't think we can finish our discussion without touching on it uh if you say the
7:51:13
name nietzsche to most educated people in the west nowadays what they immediately think of is the nazis
7:51:20
and the nazis seem to have appropriated nietzsche as their philosopher in the same sort of way as they appropriated
7:51:26
wagner as their composer and that's had the effect ever since of contaminating
7:51:32
the reputation of those two geniuses in the minds of large numbers of people now
7:51:38
is it fair or is it unfair to associate nature with fascism i think he must be
7:51:43
associated with it to some extent and fascism rather national socialism it was mussolini who read him extensively who
7:51:50
received a copy of the collected works from the furore on the brenner in 1938 as a
7:51:56
present hitler himself i think probably knew phrases i mean certainly new phrases like the world to power but
7:52:03
hadn't read anything of his i think in some ways this is a justifiable charge and i would put it
7:52:10
this way that to the extent that these parties depended upon their intellectuals and to the extent that the
7:52:16
intellectuals depended upon some sort of more or less ill-assorted ideology
7:52:21
nietzsche was part of it but of course at the same time i think it's to be emphasized very strongly there are lots
7:52:27
of things in him much more important things in him which are absolute anathema to these people to these
7:52:33
gangsters let's put it quite quite plainly and self-control and the the inward struggle of the self and the
7:52:40
attainment of valid of of of generosity for instance uh and and and greatness of
7:52:48
the kind that we have described have nothing whatever to do with the kind of
7:52:53
murderous uh ideologies that came into being in the third rush and among the
7:52:59
and and early on among the italians and it's quite plain from the fact that you yourself have devoted so much of your
7:53:06
life to studying nietzsche and writing about you that you think this is a hugely valuable undertaking yes
7:53:12
nevertheless yes i certainly think it is an immensely valuable undertaking providing we do not go to it with some
7:53:19
expectation of getting a panacea on how to live right but provided we go to it
7:53:24
with a view to finding out what human beings can do what the human possibility is what the
7:53:31
being of man is capable of understanding and creating from within itself
7:53:37
thank you very much professor stone thank you i'm joined by surveymore one philosopher active
Hubert Dreyfus on Husserl and Heidegger
7:53:43
earlier in this century who was much more important than his reputation outside the subject might suggest was
7:53:49
the german hustle edmund hussell who was born in 1859 and died in
7:53:54
1938 his acknowledged masterpiece is a book called logical investigations
7:54:00
published in two volumes in 1900 and 1901 and perhaps i might also mention a
7:54:05
book called ideas published in nineteen hussel's basic approach went something
7:54:12
like this for each one of us there is one thing that is indubitably certain and that is
7:54:18
our own conscious awareness therefore if we want to build our knowledge of reality on rock solid
7:54:24
foundations that is the place from which to start but as soon as we analyze it we find
7:54:29
that awareness has to be awareness of something consciousness must be consciousness of
7:54:35
something and we are never able to distinguish inexperience between states of
7:54:40
consciousness and objects of consciousness in actual experience however careful the analysis they seem
7:54:47
to be the same thing now skeptics down the ages have argued that we can never know whether the
7:54:53
objects of our consciousness have a separate existence from us independent of our experience of them
7:55:00
hustle conceded that but insisted that they do indubitably exist as objects of
7:55:06
consciousness for us whatever other status they may have or lack and therefore that we have direct access to
7:55:13
them as objects of consciousness and can investigate them as such without making
7:55:18
any assumptions about their independent existence thus he launched a school of philosophy
7:55:24
devoted to the systematic analysis of consciousness and its objects this school is known as phenomenology
7:55:32
and one use of that word phenomenology continues to this day to refer to whatever is given in direct experience
7:55:39
regardless of any question of independent existence and our direct experience of course
7:55:45
encompasses not only material objects but all sorts of abstract things such as music mathematics not to mention our own
7:55:52
thoughts pains emotions memories and so on one of hustle's followers heidegger
7:55:58
struck out on his own with a book called being and time published in 1927 and
7:56:04
dedicated to hustle this book became the fountainhead of modern existentialism though heidegger
7:56:10
never actually liked having the label existentialist attached to him he went on to produce a great deal more
7:56:17
philosophical work in the course of a long life he died in 1976 at the age of 86 and much of that work was influential
7:56:25
but being and time remains his masterpiece later existentialist thinkers especially
7:56:31
jean-paul satra became better known to the general public and did more to propagate existentialist ideas outside
7:56:38
the confines of academic philosophy but heidegger remained very much their master
7:56:44
the very title of sartre's main philosophical work being and nothingness published in 1943 is a direct allusion
7:56:52
to heidegger's being and time so here we have a clear-cut line of
7:56:57
philosophical development which we're going to discuss in this program from hustle to heidegger and heidegger to
7:57:04
sartre and perhaps we might mention one other figure maurice merlo ponti who published
7:57:10
an important book in 1945 called the phenomenology of perception
7:57:15
he and satra were great friends at one time together they founded and edited the journal le tom modern but meryl
7:57:22
ponti died early at the age of only 53 in 1961
7:57:28
here to discuss this major tradition within modern philosophy is professor hubert dreyfuss of the university of
7:57:34
california at berkeley professor dreyfuss i said at the beginning of that introduction to our
7:57:39
discussion that hustle is is probably not well known outside academic philosophy how could
7:57:46
does it come about can you explain this for us how somebody so little known generally is of such enormous importance
7:57:53
inside philosophy well it was khusral's own idea that he was important that helped and he was
7:57:59
important in a reactionary kind of way that is he culminated a whole philosophical
7:58:06
tradition the cartesian tradition that thinks of a man's relationship to the world in terms of subjects knowing
7:58:13
objects in fact husserl thought he culminated the whole philosophical tradition from plato on because he had
7:58:20
discovered the indubitable basis on which one could ground an understanding of everything setting
7:58:28
himself up like that he's similar to the way hegel set himself up as the culmination of idealism so that
7:58:34
kierkegaard could rebel against hegel in the name of the beginning of existentialism and marx in the name of
7:58:41
materialism so husserl sets himself up as the culmination of cartesianism his
7:58:47
last book is called cartesian meditations and then other thinkers like heidegger like merlot ponti can't
7:58:54
understand what the tradition really comes to and then they can rebel against it now i try to give a sort of lightning
7:59:01
sketch in my opening words of hustle's basic approach but i think we need something a bit more substantial than
7:59:08
that to get our teeth into can you fill that out a bit yes husserl's basic idea was that
7:59:15
the mind is always directed toward objects under some aspect so i am
7:59:21
perceiving that table roughly i'm perceiving that as a table and from the top i can remember it i have beliefs
7:59:29
about it i could have desires about it all my mental content is directed and
7:59:34
hustle thought that was in fact what the essence of the mind the mind and nothing
7:59:40
else in the universe has this kind of directedness toward something outside of
7:59:45
it other than it and there is a mystery here isn't there how for example if i think about astronomical questions how
7:59:52
events inside my head can relate to distant galaxies right husserl thought
7:59:57
that was a wunderbar phenomenon and he was ready to devote his life to trying to understand it and his way of
8:00:03
understanding it was to say there must be some kind of content in the mind that
8:00:09
accounted for this aboutness or directedness the aboutness of directness is called technically intentionality in
8:00:16
the tradition and not because it has to do with our intentions but because it has to do with this directedness and he
8:00:22
said there was something which he called intentional content in the mind which
8:00:28
was sort of like a description of reality and it was by virtue of that
8:00:33
description that i could perceive or remember this table under
8:00:38
some aspect now you said earlier that uh thinkers like heidegger reacted against this
8:00:46
how did they react well at first we should say what joshua thought he got out of this he got out of it an amazing
8:00:53
uh finished edifice that was so impressive that one wouldn't actually want to react
8:00:58
against it he thought and quite rightly that it didn't matter whether there was a table there or not
8:01:04
that is it didn't matter to his philosophy he could just bracket the table in fact he could bracket the whole
8:01:10
world all he needed to study was the fact that he took it that there was a table there he performed what he called
8:01:17
the phenomenological reduction he reflected on his own intentional content and what was special about that
8:01:23
according to him was he had an indubitable basis to start from it wasn't just that he had some kind of
8:01:29
evidence that he took that to be a table as he put it he had indubitable evidence
8:01:35
that he had himself produced taking it to be a table was just taking it to be a
8:01:41
table he couldn't be wrong about that secondly he had absolute grounding
8:01:46
because i couldn't experience anything music other people tables galaxies as
8:01:52
you mentioned i couldn't experience anything at all except by virtue of my directed mental content so he thought he
8:01:59
had discovered the indubitable foundation which is the condition of the possibility of our being able to
8:02:06
encounter anything and he found it in this relation of subjects directed toward objects now that is as you say
8:02:13
the combination of a whole tradition of philosophy stemming at least from descartes if not from before
8:02:19
of see of seeing man's situation as that of a subject confronted by objects now
8:02:26
it's that that really heidegger reacted against that's right that that cartesian tradition became so clear and in a
8:02:33
certain way so persuasive in husserl that heidegger was driven to see whether
8:02:38
that really was the true description of the phenomena because husserl kept saying we must go to the things
8:02:44
themselves and let them show themselves as they are in themselves and when heidegger actually looked at the way
8:02:50
human beings are related to the world he found that it wasn't as subjects related to objects at all that awareness and
8:02:57
consciousness didn't play any role now that seems very strange how could it be
8:03:03
well he took as his example and he was good at going to simple examples uh hammering when an expert carpenter is
8:03:10
simply hammering if the hammer is working well and he's a master at what he's doing the hammer becomes
8:03:16
transparent for him it isn't as if he's a subject contemplating the hammer maybe he's paying attention to the nails but
8:03:22
if the nails are going in well and he's really good and if he's been doing it all day he doesn't even have to pay attention to that he can think about
8:03:29
lunch or he can talk to some fellow carpenter and everything is going on with what i would call transparent
8:03:35
coping heidegger calls that the ready to hand when you look at our ready to hand
8:03:40
relation to things you just don't find subjects contemplating objects
8:03:46
this is such a a contrast with the traditional approach to philosophy that i think it's worth
8:03:51
going over it again perhaps in slightly different terms that from descartes onwards philosophers had
8:03:58
thought of the human being as a subject relating to objects and therefore
8:04:04
because of that the central philosophical problems were seen to be how do we as subject have knowledge of
8:04:10
these objects and the central problems to which philosophers addressed themselves were about perception about
8:04:17
whether we have any certain knowledge at all if so how we got it how we knew we had it and so on now heidegger isn't
8:04:24
saying that these problems don't exist but what he's saying is that this is not what is central to the human situation
8:04:31
we aren't as it were separate subjects looking through some invisible plate glass window at an objective reality
8:04:38
which is out there and to which we try to relate or of which we try to get knowledge
8:04:44
we are from the beginning in amongst it all we are in there in the world so to
8:04:51
speak coping with it so that we are not primarily observing or knowing beings at all in
8:04:58
the way that traditional philosophers have treated us as being we are we are coping beings or we're even he
8:05:03
might have been inclined to say we are being beings and it's from there that we start that's right it's a relationship
8:05:11
of uh for instance as gilbert ryle put it when he reviewed
8:05:16
being in time he reviewed both being in time and husserl's logical investigations he thought they were both good but he thought heidegger was really
8:05:23
on to something interesting rile distinguished knowing that which is what the tradition always be been interested
8:05:28
in from knowing how which is what he took heidegger to be interested in and that isn't just to claim the primacy of
8:05:35
practical activity though that's radical enough the pragmatists have claimed that too it was to have an analysis of
8:05:42
practical activity that didn't need to bring in mental content like desiring
8:05:48
believing following a rule you could you could try to explain hammering as
8:05:54
in more mental activity but heidegger said if you really observe it or to take another of his favorite examples he said
8:06:00
to his students when you come into the classroom you must turn the doorknob but you don't
8:06:05
observe the doorknob believe that you have to turn the doorknob to get in try to turn the doorknob all you do all we
8:06:12
know is here you are in the classroom and you couldn't have got here without turning the doorknob you have no memory of it because the whole activity was so
8:06:19
transparent it didn't even pass through consciousness a driver has the same experience shifting from first to second
8:06:25
they do a lot of fancy footwork with the clutch but they can be carrying on a deep philosophical conversation it
8:06:31
doesn't even have to be conscious although these although these examples are mundane and trivial what they
8:06:38
actually illustrate is of enormous importance isn't it because what they show is that our conscious act or even
8:06:44
that is begging the question that our activity is not characteristically determined by
8:06:50
conscious choices and aware states of mind at all and that is of great significance that's
8:06:57
right now heidegger didn't want to deny that there was a place for that he said in his language first and foremost we
8:07:03
are coping beings uh already involved in the world but if something should go
8:07:09
wrong for instance in the hammer case if the hammer is too heavy then i will
8:07:14
notice this aspect too heavy and i'll become a problem solver like the tradition thought human beings were i'll
8:07:20
become a rational animal and i will say for this task it's too heavy if i take another hammer then it might work better
8:07:26
the kind of aristotelian practical syllogism all of that has its place the same as the doorknob sticks then i have
8:07:33
to try to turn the doorknob heidegger calls that the unready to hand and he thinks that's the level i presume that
8:07:40
he thinks that's the level at which husserl came into the story one crucial step too late and there is another level
8:07:47
while we're at it which heidegger calls the present at hand which is important too we can get in a stance of just
8:07:52
staring at the object if the hammer the head flies off the hammer for instance or if the nails are missing or if we're
8:07:59
just feeling in a relaxed attitude of wonder we can see the hammer as a wooden shank with an iron blob on the
8:08:06
end then we see it as a object with properties it weighs say one pound if
8:08:13
that's the level two that philosophers have always studied there's a whole logic of subjects and predicates
8:08:19
discussed in what's called the predicate calculus that has its place heidegger would say but that's a third level down
8:08:25
the line after you left out the everyday coping and even left out the practical situation in which things can break down
8:08:32
because that hammer isn't even a broken down hammer it's just a piece of wood with metal on the end but that's
8:08:37
important too heidegger would say because it's by relating those kinds of predicates with laws that we get science
8:08:45
and theory and heidegger thought science and theory was very important he has what he calls an existential account of
8:08:50
science in being in time but what's important to him is to realize that to get to these
8:08:56
predicates and laws of science you have to leave out the whole level of practical coping in the world so you
8:09:03
shouldn't have the idea that scientific theory that can explain causal things very well could ever
8:09:09
explain the everyday meaningful world of significance that heidegger wants to talk about because what he's saying in
8:09:16
effect is that we only become conscious of things in most cases when something goes wrong when there's a specific
8:09:22
problem but that for most of the time we're kind of moving in a medium we're swimming in a medium that we take
8:09:29
utterly for granted and are not conscious of and don't direct our attention to at all
8:09:34
and one consequence of that is that unlike traditional philosophers he sees the world as being not as being
8:09:41
something that's inferred i mean the traditional philosopher talks as if what
8:09:46
i have access to is my mind with its contents and from these contents i infer
8:09:53
the existence of a world external to myself and heidegger is saying no no that is not actually what the situation
8:10:00
is at all the world is not something i infer i start with it and in it is that
8:10:06
that's right uh the way he put it was that philosophers since descartes had been trying to prove the existence of
8:10:12
the external world and kant said that it was a scandal that no one had successfully proved the existence of the
8:10:18
external world heidegger says in being in time it's a scandal that people are trying to prove the existence of the
8:10:23
external world as if we were stuck with this internal world and couldn't get out whereas we are as he puts it being in
8:10:30
the world i think i should explain that a little bit further because we've only talked so far about the directedness
8:10:36
being not the kind of mental directedness that husserl was interested in but any particular directedness of my
8:10:43
mind toward the hammer i'm using for my me not my mind toward the hammer using this hammer takes place on a whole
8:10:50
background which he calls the world the hammer only makes sense in terms of nails and wood and houses and other a
8:10:57
totality of equipment which he calls significance and my skill of hammering
8:11:02
only makes sense in a whole background of other skills of standing and moving and wearing my clothes and talking and
8:11:09
so forth so it's on the background of the world and my capacities for being in
8:11:16
that world or really being of that world you might say that anything gets encountered at all so as you say you
8:11:24
can't call that into question and this uh launches him into forming a
8:11:30
view of human beings which is radically different from the traditional philosopher's view of human beings isn't
8:11:36
it can you begin to tell us what that is well it's certainly he can't talk about subjects or persons or minds or the and
8:11:45
and he he needs a completely new word to even talk about this ongoing activity on a background and he
8:11:53
chooses brilliantly to you as a word dozen in german does i mean simply
8:12:00
existence like you earn your daily bread you would earn your daily design and but
8:12:05
it also means if you take it apart being the there and so he thinks that
8:12:12
this activity of human being which he sees as an activity is an activity of being
8:12:19
the there which for him is being the situation in which this coping is going
8:12:24
on so when i'm driving there is if we're looking at that aspect of me which is coping not in my body it's just
8:12:32
identical with the driving situation so that being the there is
8:12:38
actively being a situation in which directed activity is
8:12:43
going on and that's a completely new understanding of what it is to be a human being and dozen
8:12:52
also gives them the possibility as we have with the word human being of either talking about that activity human being
8:12:59
or to talk about a human being and instance of that activity and he does both and he actually offers
8:13:06
us an analysis doesn't he of this particular kind of being or way of being
8:13:12
that we are which relates it directly to time and hence the title of his most famous book
8:13:19
can you explain what that relationship is yes we better spell that out the the relationship of he's another word that's
8:13:26
handy here this relationship of of opening a clearing because another word for the situation is a clearing and
8:13:32
there is this activity of clearing this clearing which we are and he says this
8:13:38
activity has a three-fold structure first he says we
8:13:43
that is dozen has what he calls disposition the best example of which is
8:13:48
moods that is thanks to a basic characteristic of us we are things show
8:13:54
up for us as mattering as threatening or attractive or stubborn or useful and so
8:14:01
forth or just important in some way or important in some way and the tradition has generally overlooked that he thinks
8:14:07
because it doesn't easily fall into these knowing interests but he says of course rightly
8:14:14
that it's very important that things show up for us as mattering and they do because we have this basic characteristic called disposition and
8:14:21
we're always already in a situation and it always already matters some way we
8:14:26
don't ever get behind our moods and start from no mood and then step into one the second
8:14:33
structure he calls discourse which is a little bit misleading but it grows out of a kind of
8:14:40
interesting pun that is he says the world is always articulated that is right now everything
8:14:47
is already laid out in this what he calls context of significance all pieces of equipment fitting together
8:14:55
so that we can use any particular one and i'm always articulating the world
8:15:00
that is breaking it up at its joints by using a piece of equipment if i take out of this
8:15:05
total which he calls a referential or a totality of significance a hammer i can articulate it by hammering with it
8:15:12
as a hammer or i can articulate it as a nail puller under different aspects and then of course i can talk about what i'm
8:15:18
doing i can say the snail is hard to pull then i will be articulating even further
8:15:25
what i had already articulated and that's constantly going on that's called discourse and the third
8:15:32
aspect which has been implicit in what we've been saying is the dozen is always pressing into the future if i'm
8:15:38
hammering with a nail it's in order to say repair a house in order to
8:15:43
do my job as homemaker say or carpenter dozen in heidegger talk is using
8:15:50
equipment in order to pursue some goal which he calls towards which
8:15:56
for the sake of some ultimate let's say life plan uh which he calls for the sake
8:16:02
of now it's important not to speak about goals and life plans his funny language is necessary because a goal is what you
8:16:08
have in your mind or a life plan whereas he just says dozen is always oriented
8:16:14
toward the future doing something now in order to get to do something later and
8:16:19
that all of this makes sense as oriented toward something which is what that
8:16:25
person is up to and that three-fold structure which is
8:16:30
being already in admits things and always ahead of itself
8:16:36
pressing into the future is as you let the cat out of the bag the structure of
8:16:41
time in the second half of being in time lo and behold the threefold structure of
8:16:47
being in the world or being in a situation turns out to be mappable on
8:16:52
past present and future and he ends up saying almost that being is time doesn't that's right
8:16:58
anyway we are embodied time that's in his language is care and the
8:17:05
structure of care is temporality yeah now we've talked up to this point as
8:17:10
just about the individual human being what uh heidegger calls court's design
8:17:15
and its position in the world and all these various aspects of it that you've been spelling out but of course
8:17:22
heidegger doesn't suppose that he's the only being that exists and you and i when we talk about this don't suppose
8:17:28
that you or i are the only beings that exist the world is full of people how do
8:17:34
all the other people or the other designs come into this picture well it's
8:17:39
very important that they come in from the very start in fact it's a big problem for cartesians like descartes
8:17:45
and husserl they have the same problem about other minds that they have about the external world because they start
8:17:50
with an individual autonomous isolated subject heidegger starts an entirely different way closer
8:17:57
to the phenomena and saving him from this problem he says we all already do
8:18:02
what anyone does i hammer with a hammer because one hammers with hammers in our culture i eat the way one eats i
8:18:09
pronounce words the way one pronounces words in our country and you have to or you wouldn't be understood that's right and
8:18:16
in fact people subtly constantly people can't stand distance heidegger says
8:18:21
meaning people subtly lead other people to correct their pronunciation or whatever and they don't
8:18:28
have to be coerced into it people are eager not to deviate from the norm it's just a basic fact about human beings so
8:18:35
we grow up heidegger doesn't talk genetically but we could say it helpfully a baby gets socialized into a
8:18:43
bunch of shared public practices and starts doing what one does and saying
8:18:48
what one says and at that point this baby has dozyne in it to talk like
8:18:54
heidegger and of course this one doesn't mean just the masses as heidegger says in one point we flee from the crowd the
8:19:00
way one flees from the crowd but even when we flee from the crowd we do it the way one does it so finally heidegger
8:19:07
says about dozen that normally does ein is what it does and
8:19:13
or one is what one does or does on self is an is a oneself
8:19:21
if one takes together various aspects of what you've said up to this point they could be rather disquieting i mean
8:19:26
you've just said that no one does what one does and lives the way one does because that is how we are socially
8:19:33
conditioned and we have to do it for the most part you were saying much earlier that
8:19:39
heidegger rejected the idea that most of our activity is directed by conscious
8:19:45
choices and decisions and mentally aware reflection
8:19:51
if you take these things together doesn't that rather reduce the human agent
8:19:56
to a sort of zombie i mean somebody who is merely responding to pressures on him from outside in an
8:20:02
unreflecting way that's quite right this this anyone this self that just does what one does
8:20:09
in an unreflective way sounds pretty much like a very uh zombie-like
8:20:14
character but heidegger is trying to do things the other way around he now will show you how we can get free individuals
8:20:22
to crystallize out of this rather amorphous public us and that's the
8:20:27
subject of division two of being in time the subject of authenticity what the
8:20:32
part of heidegger which is really existentialist so far we haven't said anything very existentialist but in
8:20:37
division two heidegger talks about guilt and about death which i don't have time to go into here but guilt and death all
8:20:44
turn out to be versions of anxiety which we better talk about for a minute a dozen according to heidegger any dozen
8:20:52
anywhere is always dimly aware that thus the way
8:20:58
the world is is ungrounded by that i mean there's no reason why one has to do
8:21:04
things this way it there it isn't because it's rational to do things this way it isn't because god ordered us to
8:21:10
do things this way it isn't because human nature requires we do them this way heidegger is
8:21:16
as an existentialist says at one point that the essence of design is its existence meaning there is no human
8:21:22
nature we are what we take ourselves to be how we interpret ourselves in our practices but that is
8:21:29
rather unsettling and that's exactly his word for it anxiety is the experience is
8:21:34
the disposition that is our response to the fundamentally unsettling character
8:21:40
of being dozen and the question then is what do you do about it
8:21:46
well what you have to do about it is you can either flee it in which case one
8:21:53
goes back to the kind of conformity which is required just to be
8:21:58
intelligible i have to do what one does and talk like one talks but you become a conformist you try even more to shape up
8:22:06
to the norms to pronounce things the right way and dressed the right way and everything that's how you could flee
8:22:12
into inauthenticity literally that would mean something like disowning what it is to be done
8:22:17
or you can own up to what it is to be designed to own up means for heidegger to hold on to
8:22:24
anxiety and not flee it and if you do that you will be catapulted into an
8:22:29
entirely different way of being human now what you do needn't change because you only can do what one does whether or
8:22:36
just be kooky and insane so you go on doing probably the same thing you did but how you do it changes completely you
8:22:44
no longer expect to get any deep final meaning out of anything so you don't
8:22:49
embrace projects with the conviction that now at last this is going to make sense of your life so and
8:22:55
you also don't then drop all your projects because they fail to make the ultimate meaning you're looking for as
8:23:02
one of my students once said you are able to stick with things without getting stuck with them and in often in
8:23:08
in this authentic activity heidegger says you no longer have to respond to what he calls the general situation
8:23:15
you can respond to what he calls the unique situation he doesn't give any examples but i take it to be something
8:23:20
like this take his carpenter that he's always talking about with his hammer when he puts his hammer down for lunch
8:23:26
he could just have his sausages and sauerkraut but if there's beautiful flowers blooming outdoors and he's
8:23:33
authentic he doesn't have to do what a respectable carpenter does he can go out
8:23:38
and wander in the flowers and but it's important that he can do only what one does he can't take off all
8:23:44
his clothes and roll in the flowers one doesn't do that but there's a little space for authenticity
8:23:50
namely doing the sort of thing that one does enables you to respond to the unique situation without concern for
8:23:57
respectability and conformity and that kind of life not trying to get absolute meaning and
8:24:03
responding to the current situation makes you an individual heidegger says makes you flexible alive
8:24:11
gay fro in in german and that is his idea of how one should live put that way
8:24:16
you make it sound like a sort of philosophy of personal liberation well here's this phrase philosophy of
8:24:21
liberation used about a lot of political philosophies but this is as it were an
8:24:26
individual liberation philosophy is it not but it's an existentialist liberation philosophy which makes it the
8:24:32
sort of last and strangest liberation philosophy we don't liberate say our sexual drives or our repressed classes
8:24:39
the liberation comes from realizing that there's no deep truth to liberate no
8:24:45
deep meaning in dozen accepting the ungrounded and unsettledness
8:24:50
is itself liberty yeah now in the whole of this discussion you've been forced to use some very strange terms like like
8:24:57
darzyne and to use ordinary words in some unusual ways and when one reads
8:25:02
being in time because everything we've talked about so far is what's contained in being and time the early heidegger
8:25:10
when one reads this book this vocabulary really does become very difficult to cope with in fact i think it's one of
8:25:16
the most difficult books to read and understand that i ever have read but you've actually in spite of that
8:25:22
difficulty succeeded in making a lot of these ideas clear why didn't heidegger do that why did he
8:25:29
have to be so obscure well it's implied in what i did if he could have done what i was just doing
8:25:35
namely using the wrong word and then backing off and using the right word that probably would have been the best
8:25:41
thing to do for instance i talked about goals and then said but of course they're not really goals because that's too mental and life plans but they're
8:25:47
not really plans and then i introduced his funny language the towards which and the for the sake of and i said we had to
8:25:53
use design because we're a way of being but not a mind directed toward things in general
8:25:58
he would say the whole philosophical tradition has passed over the world and
8:26:04
our usual kind of involved coping with the world not only because it's something you
8:26:11
don't notice if everything is going well but also because we have no language for it since we don't need any language for
8:26:17
it we need language for how to repair the doorknob and how to get a lighter hammer if the hammer is too heavy but we
8:26:22
don't need language to describe the way everything is when it's going transparently well and the kind of being
8:26:29
we are when everything's going transparently well so heidegger would say he has to make up a whole new vocabulary for this
8:26:36
and once you get in it it does seem to be the right econo economical vocabulary
8:26:42
and he uses it rigorously so that when he's taken up a new word like ready to hand unready to hand or present at hand
8:26:49
he sticks to it so once you get in this language it's really a very elegant and simple language being in time was
8:26:56
published and was presented when it was published as being the first volume of what was to be of a two-volume work
8:27:03
but volume two never came out did it because uh heidegger in fact changed his
8:27:08
views and that made him unable to finish the project and this change is itself
8:27:14
very frequently referred to in the literature about heidegger it's it's called the turn de kera the german word
8:27:21
now in what way does the later heidegger differ from the earlier heidegger what
8:27:27
what are the real grounds of the difference there are a lot of different views of this and it's not a subtle
8:27:33
question in heidegger scholarship people say he got he went from a resolute sort of grasping of things to a kind of
8:27:40
openness and so forth that's probably true but i don't think that's the essence of it there's at one point i
8:27:46
think he says it clearly where he says that he has changed to thinking being
8:27:51
historically and that that's what he wasn't doing before you can see that he wasn't doing it before because everything i've explained
8:27:58
so far was supposed to be about the structure of all human beings anywhere anytime
8:28:04
even anxiety was supposed to be this what any human being experienced and
8:28:09
fled from or faced up to but now heidegger gets the idea that there is something special about each epoch of
8:28:16
our understanding of being and that he had been talking only about the modern epoch without realizing it and he begins
8:28:22
to try to describe these various epochs for the greeks they felt rooted they weren't unsettled and things showed up
8:28:28
for them as natural and they appreciated them and for the christians they felt that they were creators created and that
8:28:36
the all the things they dealt with were creatures and that they could read god's plan out of the world and for us we have
8:28:43
another understanding of being an understanding of being where everything is objects for us to
8:28:49
control and use and we're subjects with desires to satisfy so that these are all
8:28:56
different understandings of what it is to be a thing what it is to be a person what it is to be an institution
8:29:01
heidegger would say different understandings of what it is to be and if you have a different understanding of
8:29:07
what it is to be then different sort of things show up for the greeks heroes showed up and and
8:29:13
beautiful things in homer for the christians saints and sinners showed up you can't have any saints and sinners in
8:29:18
greece they would just be poor people everybody walked all over you can't have any heroes in the middle ages they would
8:29:24
be proud people who were damned so different sorts of peoples and things show up and heidegger now thinks he
8:29:30
should talk about the kind of peoples and things that show up in our understanding of being
8:29:35
now one of the ways you can point out this change just for an example is he thinks anxiety isn't a universal
8:29:42
structure when he gets to later heidegger thinks this anxiety the greece didn't have it
8:29:48
christians didn't have it he thinks we have it because we have what he calls a technological nihilistic understanding
8:29:54
of being and that that is a distressing rootless anxious making understanding of being
8:30:01
if he's moving from something which is perennial or at least which he regards of being a
8:30:07
perennial universal in human experience to considering something which he
8:30:12
regards as being as it were topical to our age and for that reason ephemeral so
8:30:18
that in 200 years time when we're all dead that this will all be past history and something else will be the case
8:30:24
isn't his philosophy ceasing to be uh concern itself with the permanent and
8:30:30
just concerning itself with the superficial well if this were any old culture or
8:30:35
even any old stage of our culture he would say yes and what he was doing would then be soon passed as you're
8:30:41
saying but he thinks that this is a very special culture and that we're in a very special stage of this very special
8:30:46
culture it's a special culture for him because we're the only culture that has history in any culture events follow one after
8:30:53
another but only in ours does the understanding of being changed from the greek to the christian to the modern and
8:31:00
that's that's historicity in heidegger language and we
8:31:05
happen to stand in a special place in our culture an understanding of being that started with plato two thousand
8:31:11
years ago has gone through all sorts of philosophical and practical transformations until it is now finished
8:31:19
in heidegger terms that means all the philosophical moves have been tried and played out completed
8:31:26
and now it's done for it's a sort of pun unfinished it's this he gets this idea
8:31:32
from nietzsche who influenced him a lot we're in we have reached a stage of planetary
8:31:37
technology where we are now taking over the whole planet our understanding of being is dominating every understanding
8:31:44
of being and our understanding of being has come to a dead end which heidegger calls nihilism
8:31:51
one aspect of the late heidegger which we haven't touched on and we must i think before we move on
8:31:57
to the thinkers after heidegger is his concern with language the later heidegger is not just concerned with
8:32:03
language he's almost obsessed by language isn't he why is that well we're in a way set to see that because since
8:32:10
there's no way the world is in itself language isn't there to correspond to reality nor is language there just to be
8:32:17
made up arbitrarily for heidegger a vocabulary or the kind of metaphors one
8:32:24
uses name things into being when in california somebody said that everybody
8:32:30
was laid back there were already people with hot tubs taking it easy and taking drugs but now
8:32:36
they discovered that that all fitted together and they were laid back so there was more of it so language is a
8:32:42
marvelously powerful way to change the practices focus them uh and add new practices to
8:32:50
dozens way of life so it's the poets not the philosophers or the priests or the scientists who are the vanguard of
8:32:57
humanity and the hope of some new understanding of being
8:33:02
now i think we've been quite right to devote almost the whole of this discussion to heidegger because he has
8:33:07
found a way the most important uh 20th century existentialist philosopher but i did say in the
8:33:13
introduction to this discussion that we would touch on others and i think we must do so now before we bring the
8:33:19
discussion to a close uh what i mentioned specifically saatra and
8:33:26
merlo ponti let's take them in that order the chronological order um
8:33:32
how would you characterize satra's relationship as a philosopher to heidegger
8:33:37
well sartre starts out as a hostilian and becomes a phenomenologist writes a
8:33:42
good novel called nausea which is a phenomenological description of a world breaking down but then he read heidegger
8:33:49
and he was converted to what he thought was heidegger but he felt he had to fix up heidegger as a frenchman and make it
8:33:55
cartesian so he starts with the individual subject and tries to get and to talk about death and guilt and all
8:34:02
the things that heidegger talks about but that's a disaster because if this story we've been telling is right that's
8:34:07
what heidegger was trying to free us from in fact when i went to visit heidegger he had being and nothingness
8:34:12
on his desk in german translation and i said oh you're reading sartre and he said how can i even begin to read this
8:34:19
muck his word was drek and that's pretty strong and i think that's accurate because what happens if you treat uh
8:34:26
heidegger as if he were talking about subjects is you really push him back to husserl it's difficult to believe actually that sartre will survive as a
8:34:32
philosopher at all though he might survive as a novelist and a playwright uh what's your view of merolo ponti
8:34:40
i'm very much more impressed with merlot ponte i think he's a great philosopher and will survive his great contribution
8:34:47
was to bring in the body as our way of being in the world there are two big
8:34:53
gaps in being in time one of them is that heidegger never talks about the body or even about skills or practices i
8:35:00
put all that in to explain the ready to hand and the understanding of being now merlot ponte because he does talk
8:35:07
about the body and it's the body that acquires skills he answers sartre for one thing he says we're not free we're
8:35:14
restricted by having the same sort of bodies everyone has and by the fact that what we do becoming habits in our bodies
8:35:21
and skills in our bodies which we're not arbitrarily free to change and this
8:35:27
both answers sartre and in a way oddly enough merlot ponte answering sartre who was like husserl
8:35:34
reinvents heidegger but filling in the gaps the other gap is perception
8:35:40
heidegger talks about perception as if it was just staring at things and that is unfortunate because it does seem as
8:35:46
if we spend a lot of time not only using things but seeing things but merlot ponte has an analysis of perception as a
8:35:54
embodied activity in which we move to get an optimal grip on things which
8:36:00
makes it more of the ready to hand therefore completing the heidegger picture
8:36:07
now all of the four named philosophers that we've been discussing hussell heidegger jean-paul
8:36:13
sautra and uh merlot ponte they're all dead sartre only recently dead
8:36:20
do you regard the this whole tradition of philosophy that we've been talking about is something that's now closed or
8:36:26
do you regard it as very much an alive and ongoing enterprise i think it's very
8:36:31
much alive even the phenomenology the historical side which heidegger was trying to kill off is very much alive
8:36:38
the husserl is alive in two ways one is that if you want to describe the phenomena the what it's like to listen
8:36:45
to music what it's like to have sexual desire any phenomenon hussero gives you
8:36:50
a license to do it and a method for doing it and we have young philosophers in britain who are doing precisely that
8:36:56
sort of thing now and in the united states too the other side of his role is if anything even more alive and active
8:37:03
namely he was interested in the structure of the intentional content of that in the mind that enables us to
8:37:09
refer to things now there's something called cognitive science actually trying to investigate empirically the structure
8:37:16
of our mental representations as they would say and husserl has laid down the general guidelines that anybody doing
8:37:23
that investigation will follow or if you're trying to build a mind as people using computers and artificial
8:37:28
intelligence are doing husserl is also the father of artificial intelligence many of his ideas that the mind follows
8:37:34
hierarchies of strict rules are now being cashed out into computer programs
8:37:40
so lister's doing fine heidegger's doing fine too early hiding or being in time is not
8:37:46
perhaps as in as much followed now as it should be i'm using it the way i use it is as i've
8:37:53
been using it here if you if you actually get back to the phenomena of our engaged everyday
8:37:59
activity you can criticize the linguistic analysts who either trust
8:38:04
their intuitions or trust our linguistic categories heidegger would say and i think a
8:38:10
description of skills shows it that if you trust our intuitions you talk always about beliefs desires and so forth and
8:38:17
that that's not an adequate description of what's normally going on it's only a breakdown description and likewise we
8:38:23
talked about how our language mirrors not the everyday coping but the breakdown so there heidegger
8:38:30
phenomenology gives us a good point for criticizing some un unquestioned assumptions of contemporary
8:38:36
anglo-american philosophy and finally in europe now particularly in france later
8:38:41
heidegger is the great father of those who want to as he
8:38:47
already put it deconstruct the tradition for instance michel foucault and jacques derrida are trying to follow out the
8:38:54
heidegger project of defining exactly what our understanding of being is in
8:39:00
order to help us get over it so i would say that there is hardly any area of intellectual activity these days in
8:39:07
which the concerns of these thinkers don't play a large role well thank you very much for that professor dreyfuss
Sidney Morgenbesser on the American Pragmatists
8:39:15
in philosophy as in so many other respects it's now the united states rather than britain that is the chief
8:39:21
center of activity in the english-speaking world but there's been american philosophy of international importance for a hundred
8:39:27
years now in fact bertrand russell in his autobiography describes the harvard
8:39:32
school of philosophy as having been the best in the world during the late 19th and early 20th centuries
8:39:39
american philosophy of that period is represented above all by three figures who have since attained classic status c
8:39:46
s purse william james and john dewey they are sometimes given a group label
8:39:52
the american pragmatists but in fact they're more different from each other than that might suggest
8:39:58
c s perce was born in 1839 the son of a professor of mathematics at harvard he
8:40:03
was trained from the beginning as a mathematician and scientist and his paid jobs were as astronomer and physicist
8:40:10
philosophy was something he did in his spare time until at the age of 48 he retired to devote himself to it entirely
8:40:17
but this i'm afraid led to his being sunk in poverty and debt by the time he died in 1914 at the age of 74.
8:40:25
he never wrote a book and a great deal of his work came out only posthumously when his collected papers were published
8:40:31
in eight volumes a near contemporary of purse was william james born in 1842 and also educated at
8:40:39
harvard from which he graduated in medicine james became a harvard lecturer in anatomy and physiology then after that
8:40:46
professor of philosophy and then after that professor of psychology among his best-known books are the
8:40:52
principles of psychology published in 1890 the varieties of religious experience published in 1902
8:40:59
and pragmatism published in 1907. he died in 1910
8:41:05
unlike purse he received international recognition during his lifetime in this context it's interesting to
8:41:11
mention that the novelist henry james was one of his brothers and henry for part if not most of his life felt
8:41:18
himself under the shadow of world famous elder brother william the third and most recent of our three
8:41:24
classical american philosophers was john dewey who was born in 1859 and lived until 1952.
8:41:31
he spent the whole of his career as a university teacher first at the university of michigan then in chicago
8:41:37
and finally at columbia new york few philosophers of any place or time
8:41:42
have had such widespread influence on practical and public affairs his philosophy of education alone can be
8:41:49
said to have had worldwide impact and he was influential in other fields as well
8:41:54
it's difficult to pick a few books from so copious and output but perhaps i might mention democracy and education
8:42:00
published in 1916 human nature and conduct published in 1922
8:42:06
experience and nature published in 1925 and the quest for certainty published in
8:42:12
1929 to discuss the work of dewey james and perth i've invited sydney morgan besser
8:42:19
professor of philosophy at columbia university in new york now let's let's start right at the beginning of the
8:42:25
story the first of these people in time was purse and it was him who introduced the term pragmatism as a philosophical
8:42:32
term and he introduced it first of all as a maxim uh
8:42:38
for meaning didn't he can you explain exactly what that meant so it was a maximum
8:42:43
clarification of certain kinds of terms which are called intellectual terms yes it was not necessarily a theory of
8:42:49
meaning for all terms or how to analyze all terms uh that he also dealt with in
8:42:56
a later book but in this essay it was primarily a theory of how one analyzes
8:43:01
specific terms or specific ideas or if you wish sentences in which these terms are
8:43:06
embedded he was motivated to try to tell someone how he can be clear of his ideas uh sort
8:43:14
of an approach to give rules for clarification so that if an agent acts he at least knows the beliefs clearly
8:43:20
upon which he acts that's the motivation in the background now what was the the pragmatic criterion of meaning what was
8:43:27
that well i can give it by illustration you consider the practical effects of the concept as it were but
8:43:33
let me sort of begin with an example and then see whether we can build up from examples right let's say if i asked you
8:43:39
what you meant when you said something sugar is soluble in water i presume you
8:43:44
would mean that if i or anyone put the sugar in water at dissolve here to get
8:43:50
clearly in mind what you mean you would specify if you wish some conditional as to what would happen or what kind of
8:43:56
consequences would happen or what actions or habits the particular entity has that you could activate
8:44:03
as it were by your actions it relates the meaning of the concept to an actual or possible action or event
8:44:10
yes the meaning would be specified in this conditional right so that now if you take a particular sentence in the
8:44:17
indicative like this particular hammer is hard or whatever we will
8:44:23
attribute the predicate heart and here's the indicative and the persian view is well you should be
8:44:30
able to translate the indicative into these kinds of conditionals if it were not possible for you really wouldn't
8:44:35
have a clear concept of mind well it's just hard hard hard and you would then suggest or he would suggest to try to
8:44:42
clarify the specific kinds of things that if the particular entity was acted upon
8:44:49
some particular observable consequence would happen in terms of scratching or what would so to bring it down to
8:44:55
ordinary speech what what person is saying is that for certain kinds of concept to be meaningful
8:45:02
then their application in reality must make an observable difference to something if they don't make an
8:45:08
observable difference to anything then they don't have real questions these are conditionals they would that's right now
8:45:14
this would be it's not necessarily a statement that it has carried out no no no
8:45:19
it's about meaning it's not about occurrence if i placed it in water it would this is only for the clarification of a certain term right i want to push
8:45:26
the discussion a little further along uh because although uh purse made this a
8:45:31
very substantial contribution to theory of meaning he wasn't concerned with theory of meaning in a sort of
8:45:36
scholastic way was he wasn't concerned with it in isolation for him it was all part of a much more general concern with
8:45:43
science i emphasized in my introduction to this discussion how perc the man
8:45:48
was all his life a working scientist that's what he was and he was a logician and he was and he was concerned to
8:45:55
clarify concepts clarify statements clarify beliefs as part of a much wider scientific
8:46:02
enterprise whose aim was to understand the world and to acquire new knowledge wasn't it yes can you put it
8:46:09
in that context first i'll amplify some of the remarks about the meaning that you suggested he said he
8:46:15
learned these habits in the laboratory that's how scientists get clear about his terms yes in the 20th century some
8:46:22
people thought that one clarifies terms in that way which called operational definitions you know when to apply if
8:46:29
certain things are done by you then these and these would be the observational consequences
8:46:36
but that's the background and we now go to the other topic you've introduced the notion of inquiry right i think we could
8:46:43
begin first with by inquiry of course you simply mean finding out about the words both in
8:46:48
common sense terms and more organizedly in scientific right right right and sort
8:46:54
of testing the hypothesis in a suitable way right collecting the hypothesis sort of having certain rules to tell you when
8:47:01
the hypothesis or the inference is a well-formed inference that when the conclusion follows the whole
8:47:08
nuts and bolts substructure of science that we're talking about but now i think one could begin first with sort of a
8:47:13
theorist of ordinary beliefs of the ordinary believer and taking the notion of belief now for
8:47:18
granted uh purse frequently gives the following picture i say picture because
8:47:24
this isn't quite a full presentation and suggests this picture to a lot of people that
8:47:30
normally we can sort of go along and rely on our beliefs and then
8:47:36
when we run into a problematic situation one has to have a strategy for how to revise one's beliefs
8:47:43
and there he begins with possible strategies that one could follow the method of tenacity you pick some beliefs
8:47:49
and you stick to it the method of authority you go to an authority tell you what to believe and he gives some
8:47:54
reasons why one shouldn't rely on those methods they're self-defeating
8:48:00
but now the better method is to engage in inquiry and to try to find out by inquiry which particular kind of uh
8:48:08
belief which is under test is better than its competitors by actual testing
8:48:13
in accord with certain principles and now when he does this particular view he
8:48:20
presents another theory this of how one justifies the beliefs thus far we've talked about the motivation we engage in
8:48:26
inquiry in order to fix our beliefs and we have to come to a rational decision that we have a right to accept this
8:48:32
belief rather than as competitive in order to act on it and base further work on it well
8:48:38
to have some particular rules in the background uh to form well-formulated beliefs about the nature
8:48:44
of the world and then given utilities you act he's not telling you what you should act for that's part of the ethics
8:48:49
and the aesthetics now if by hypothesis one goes a little further the following picture once again
8:48:57
is frequently presented as being relevant to purse while we test some beliefs we're holding some beliefs
8:49:03
constant and then while we're holding some belief constants in one context we
8:49:08
can subject them to check in another context and the sort of the rationality behind it is the sort of self-correcting
8:49:15
process and we don't have to begin with premises which are certain and indubitable upon which we sort of build
8:49:22
our knowledge like mathematics in fact you can always start an argument by
8:49:27
assuming something and then the conclusions followed by that argument from the issue we're talking about sort
8:49:34
of inductive reasoning or or empirical justification now
8:49:39
the point behind all of this is not to say that i mean part of the point is
8:49:45
not really to say this is the way one should view knowledge if one wants knowledge for a basis for action
8:49:51
other philosophers might agree but they would want more for knowledge knowledge would have to be a stronger view than
8:49:57
that and to counter that strong view he sometimes talks
8:50:03
that we can't get certainty and the cartesian arguments for getting certainty don't actually
8:50:10
support the conclusion that some philosophers thought it does so it was a picture of how knowledge could and
8:50:16
justification could go on it was a claim that other pictures not merely not needed but they can't be for a variety
8:50:22
of reasons maintained and therefore it turned out that very people identify
8:50:29
purse with some theory of fallibilism everything is revisable there's nothing fixed etcetera now this introduction of
8:50:36
the term fallablism is very important and indeed perce was a pioneer of the
8:50:42
whole idea and it was a revolutionary idea in its day until and including i think virtually
8:50:48
the whole of the 19th century western man regarded science as a secure
8:50:54
and uh copper-bottomed and safe and sure and unchanging body of knowledge the
8:51:00
scientific knowledge was certain knowledge and it was that for that reason incorrigible unchanging
8:51:08
purse introduced and was one of the very first people if not the first person to introduce the notion that this is not so
8:51:14
that all science is collegiable all science is fallible that we use scientific theories for as long as they
8:51:21
work but we are must be prepared to replace them if we come up against difficulties with them now that's uh an
8:51:28
orthodoxy in the 20th century all scientists take that view in our time but they certainly didn't in person
8:51:34
currently lots of people take this view of parallelism sort of as an aim of science that science shouldn't aim as a
8:51:39
complete theory that one should never say i've got it now i've just got it that science by definition is open to
8:51:46
perpetual revolution now uh that is a thesis which sometimes
8:51:51
associated with fallibilism which i'm not sure quite
8:51:57
what to say about but it's a different well let's not go into that but but but when it comes to science
8:52:04
one gets a different picture from purse the picture is a scientist entering into
8:52:10
a community he's part of a community investigation of investigators
8:52:16
truth if you wish is a sort of a property of the community in a sense which i'll try to specify uh the actual
8:52:23
scientist is not there as an individual sort of understood primarily as a as a member of the group and then we can talk
8:52:30
about inquiry in general there as a group activity and as an institution
8:52:35
right you enter into institution which is rational and reasonable and then uh one engages in acquiring jane and
8:52:43
purse has lots of things to say about the stages of inquiry uh
8:52:49
as the the for example the abductor phase one hypothesis put up to test and
8:52:54
the and the reasons for accepting them as testable uh deductive phase when their actual the consequences are noted
8:53:02
and the inductive phase when the the actual results are assessed and he has a great deal to say about all of
8:53:09
these things uh for which uh he may be credited as a forerunner of
8:53:15
diverse kinds of people like nagel or papa who have differences among them but would all
8:53:20
claim that this is along the lines that he has suggested so we have this picture of science and
8:53:27
part of percy's later motivation is to try to see what justification he can give for someone entering into this kind
8:53:33
of a community but now given this view of science and also the view that
8:53:40
if one wants to say that science captures the real or what's out there one has to sort of take it this way
8:53:46
because whatever the real is uh whatever we think is out there independently of uh one can't actually think that it's
8:53:53
only accessible to an individual person the real should be accessible to the community it's independent of any
8:53:59
particular agent and now the agent and the inquiry what's his goal
8:54:04
and here one has two aspects of purse one aspect is
8:54:11
but what sense could we give for truth in this particular context after we very frequently think of
8:54:17
each individual belief may be wrong even though i think it's true it may be wrong and
8:54:23
this way what sort of guarantee if you like the word of truth is there what concept can we give to truth and he
8:54:30
tries to develop the notion that when we say a given belief is true what we have in
8:54:35
mind is that this opinion actually will survive and be embedded into the final
8:54:41
body of of science if that is a correct way of talking now up to this point we've been talking almost entirely about
8:54:48
perth and i want to bring james more centrally into the picture now it was william james although it was
8:54:54
purse who coined the philosophical term pragmatism it was actually james who
8:55:00
made the term generally known among educated people at large and this was done primarily by his book indeed the
8:55:07
title of his book pragmatism which was published in 1907 wasn't it now what were some of the main themes of this
8:55:13
book well the book is a very rich book and it contains a number of diverse and interconnected theses
8:55:20
first it's a critique of certain kinds of philosophical positions on the ground that they were not really relevant to
8:55:26
the problems of their generation of his generation primarily the conflict between science
8:55:31
and religion which was one of the things he and his contemporaries wrestled with for a long time
8:55:37
secondly he criticizes some but not all of the philosophical things are not being
8:55:44
sort of pragmatically different i don't think he ever proves the case but he sort of tries to when you say pragmatically different what you mean is
8:55:50
that uh there were a number of apparently alternative philosophies uh which were only apparently
8:55:56
alternative because when you actually examined them you found that there was no specific evidence or even possible
8:56:03
experience which could differentiate between them and therefore cognitively they were equivalent one of the things
8:56:10
yes as he said that way and secondly he frequently also thought that they were not really different as far as uh
8:56:18
basing an uh a particular kind of decision as to how to live uh they made no difference for purposes of
8:56:24
action in that particular year now he take this whether or not he proves this is an
8:56:30
interesting thing but i'm not sure he does but this is the kind of theme that he tries to introduce the second
8:56:36
kind of theme that he tries to introduce is that one one looks a lot of these traditional metaphysical pictures one
8:56:43
should sort of look at them as that as pictures and that his own view is
8:56:49
of a lot of the metaphysics even his own it's sort of one which is based not merely on the evidence but in terms of
8:56:56
sort of bias for looking for certain kinds of things certain personal preferences and he gives his own
8:57:02
and he asks his other colleagues to do so as well within the whole notion of a picture
8:57:08
and how one justifies or looks a philosophical thing or a song once again
8:57:15
the reason i'm hesitating is because the book is dedicated to john stuart mill and he's not sort of saying pragmatism
8:57:22
comes in and it's completely novel as a matter of fact all other philosophy goes out of the window he's not saying that he's saying it's a continuation of some
8:57:29
already familiar thinking yeah now the the other thing that he introduces which for which uh
8:57:36
he's been actually uh both criticized and lauded is his
8:57:42
approach to knowledge conceptual schemes and truth and that he also
8:57:48
deals with them in other books but this is central things in this particular i'd like us to take up the last of those
8:57:53
because only a moment ago you were giving us quite a long but very interesting exposition of purses
8:57:59
theories of meaning and of truth how did james's conception of meaning and of truth
8:58:06
differ from people well he starts with how our knowledge evolves and how conceptual schemes evolve
8:58:12
and emphasize that very often we have evolving conceptual schemes
8:58:17
and one really can't ask whether this conceptual scheme or that conceptual scene is actually better or worse uh one
8:58:25
has to judge between conceptual schemes in terms of the particular use to which they're put now that's one particular
8:58:32
thing sort of pragmatic justification not of the notion of truth but the notion of conceptual scheme there's also
8:58:37
a deeper thing as to whether or not he he actually wants to to say and he
8:58:43
does want to say that we can't give an account of our conceptual schemes are sort of
8:58:48
uh merely statements about how the world is independent of us the way we classify
8:58:53
the world is actually constitutive of what we think the world is we're sort of always thinking from within with our
8:58:59
conceptual scheme but now let's assume we have a conceptual scheme and all these problems
8:59:04
about we've got a view of the world well they're free i'm not sure when it has one has to do it in terms of a total
8:59:10
conceptual scheme but uh but particular things there is a lot of work going on by people influence
8:59:16
by james on this as to whether one looks at one description isn't compatible with another
8:59:22
and one looks at sort of descriptions and that descriptions whether or not they're
8:59:28
contraries all of these things are being worked on but now let's assume that we have some notion of a local
8:59:35
conceptual scheme rather than a whole total scene because it might be pointless we necessarily have to be
8:59:41
talking about the view of the world in
8:59:46
yeah it's very difficult to know whether a clear notion can be given right to a total yes yes
8:59:51
all right now then let's say we fix our language and
8:59:56
we want then the question of truth can arise after then
9:00:01
partly he seems to be asking himself the following question
9:00:07
what actually is the difference between saying that a particular sentence like
9:00:12
uh this table is brown uh and adding this table is brown is true and often
9:00:20
maybe he can be interpreted as saying well prima facie it's puzzling nothing seems to be added
9:00:26
and say that the sentence is true is to do no more than a certain sentence yeah well in a way i mean this may be
9:00:33
a misleading way of putting it but it's sort of like you can take a theory that way and then ask but what
9:00:39
is that it and per and james seems to be suggesting that what is added is some sort of commendatory use and evaluative
9:00:46
views that talk about its truth it's a sort of say about the sentence that actually is
9:00:53
worthy of belief or it's good to believe and these kind of evaluative predicates and then he tries to work it out and he
9:00:59
tries to work it out either in terms of verification or in terms of satisfaction so sometimes he gives some view that the
9:01:07
truth can be identified with the verifiable uh or the eternal ex
9:01:12
exhaustively verified and verified by an action one has a belief one acts on it
9:01:18
and then at least the satisfactory results so this actual criticism of
9:01:24
james on this point is his use of satisfaction is misleading uh it has
9:01:29
really nothing to do with truth that may have something to do with the rationality of action of uh
9:01:35
person may be rational believing something even if it isn't true but that's a different
9:01:40
maybe agreed to talk about the rationality of action and
9:01:46
for that one doesn't need certainty but the particular issue under consideration whether this is a
9:01:52
an illuminating notion of truth and to many people james is misleading how he works it out
9:01:58
but this general approach could be at least in part uh suggested for truth the picture very often james
9:02:05
once again gives is that after or should give is that in certain contexts
9:02:11
on certain kind of canonical conditions uh if a sentence is verified then the
9:02:16
question of truth may actually disappear the gap between truth and verification
9:02:21
might disappear or be identified sorry now i wanted to interrupt you there because i want to move our
9:02:27
discussion on to to dewey we've we spent a period on purse a period on james and
9:02:32
we must leave some time for dewey before we leave james what i wanted to do was
9:02:38
to put in a word of commendation for his his writing his prose style i think that
9:02:44
james is and it needs to be said in in this program about him and others that
9:02:49
he is one of the great writers of philosophy in the history of philosophy uh some wag once said that when you read
9:02:55
william james's books and you read henry james's books you realize that brother william was the natural novelist and
9:03:01
brother henry was the natural philosopher and the point of that uh joke
9:03:06
is that william james's writing actually contains all the qualities of great creative writing it's imaginative it's
9:03:13
full of surprise it's it's ingenious it's full of striking metaphor
9:03:20
similar simile imagery and so on and i do want to say before we leave him
9:03:25
that anyone who is stimulated by our discussion to go away and read james uh is in for a serious pleasure well may i
9:03:32
add to your remarks yes i do i mean all these three men uh seem to me
9:03:38
uh but in some sense remarkable in some
9:03:43
sense uh worthy of respect but i'd like to fill out some of the things about percy sort
9:03:50
of an awesome figure uh the tremendous issues and the variety of issues that he dealt with logic inquiry
9:03:58
a certain kind of metaphysics uh he's been called by some people the leibniz of of america well when i when i looked
9:04:05
him up in the current issue of the encyclopedia britannica for this program to check a date uh i saw that it says about
9:04:12
him that he's the greatest intellect yet produced by the americas and that's an astounding yes i know he claimed to make
9:04:18
for an individual well i i'm really also i'm not asking you to underwrite it
9:04:24
it is an extraordinary place he seems to be an awesome figure james is one of the
9:04:29
great lovely admirable figures in the history philosophy he's a
9:04:34
person he's warm outgoing his writings of range over so many topics
9:04:41
the principles of psychology itself is a classic it's still being read and reread
9:04:47
by a great number of people even when they disagree with james on his specific views about
9:04:53
about psychological matters they find him very interesting and very insightful
9:04:59
the other thing is also his approach to mind he started sort of giving sort of a biological
9:05:04
particular approach the the life of the mind is how one understands mental action and
9:05:10
dewey of course was a man who was in a man true to his word he didn't
9:05:16
really preach that philosophy should be engaged in public life and he did and also
9:05:22
he didn't merely say they should be natural as he tried to work out the details and his attack and all sorts of
9:05:28
dualisms which presumably i suppose is partly to be understood in terms of his
9:05:34
galilean background he also applied this to a variety of issues the analysis of social issues and
9:05:39
politically so he has this great range he was a liberal and a kind man it's interesting when russell wrote the
9:05:45
history of philosophy he sort of said he has so much admiration for dewey he's just sorry has to disagree with him
9:05:52
another point marth making about burton russell's history of western philosophy is that the only philosopher living at
9:05:58
the time when that book was written and published who had a chapter devoted to him in it was john dewey
9:06:05
well let's now move to dewey we've talked about uh purse and james and
9:06:10
their attempts to improve the methods by which human beings can acquire new knowledge and increase their
9:06:17
understanding of their environment both in an ordinary life context and through
9:06:23
in an organized way through science and we've talked about how this involved them in among many other things
9:06:29
clarifying exactly what it is we mean by the concept of meaning clarifying exactly it is what we mean by
9:06:36
the concept of truth and finding what the proper functioning of these conflict concepts is within an
9:06:43
overall conception of inquiry whether in ordinary life or scientific inquiry now
9:06:50
we that's the the position up to which we've taken the discussion now now
9:06:55
dewey uh the start the real starting point for dewey was
9:07:00
enormous impressedness with the success of science he saw that
9:07:06
this science that we've been talking about over the last three or four hundred years has supplied mankind with
9:07:12
far and away its most reliable knowledge far and away it's quantitatively quantitatively biggest amount of
9:07:20
reliable knowledge it's a huge success story almost unprecedented in the in the cognitive
9:07:26
history of mankind well in fact unprecedented now thought dewey
9:07:32
what is it what is it about science that gives it this fantastic success
9:07:37
and is it something that we can apply to other areas of life notably the social
9:07:42
sciences political life social problems and so on with the same rich success that was
9:07:49
really his starting point well can you take it he gave some reasons if you wish for the success of science at least in
9:07:56
the sense that what science couldn't have been successful unless there was some possibility of continuation and
9:08:02
there was certain science being institutionalized its habits being institutionalized and men and women
9:08:07
engaged in cooperative research so oh yes but what really struck dewey about the successfulness of science wasn't due
9:08:14
to its institutionalization was it it was due to its methods yeah but the method is institutionalized however you
9:08:19
think the the the institutionalization as well in a way okay i mean no part of the notion no no i should be clear part
9:08:26
of the method is the method of drawing inference but also the method of cooperative research and how one engages
9:08:32
in uh kinds of decisions about cooperative research so he gave some particular explanation of
9:08:39
social support then some particular explanation in terms of this method scientists could
9:08:44
engage in cooperative research were it not this agreement on how one can adjudicate
9:08:51
conflicting alternatives uh the scientific community would not remain stable
9:08:57
now obviously the dewy picture or some picture like that is at best the first
9:09:03
approximation and one has to work out all sorts of arguments as to whether or not
9:09:09
this always can hold or whether holds only in certain cases and there's discussion about that but
9:09:16
now one can push okay okay okay granted but how we know it will continue in the future maybe tomorrow
9:09:22
suddenly all the attempts to accept the theory on the basis of evidence etc will lead to
9:09:28
failure how do we know the world isn't chaotic and ultimately or won't change and
9:09:35
now it's these kinds of questions that get puzzling and possibly one might think of this as deeply enough as
9:09:41
sort of a request if one wants to talk this way as a sort of justification of induction relying on certain kinds of
9:09:48
observable outcomes to project and for this dewey doesn't really
9:09:54
want to engage in this kind of a question he avoids that kind of a question but granted in some sense we
9:10:01
accept induction in some sense of induction because as you know how difficult it is to formulate that phrase
9:10:07
without begging lots of issues about sign if we do then we can rely on the past
9:10:13
history of science to indicate we're rationally entitled to rely on its method it has over time proven better
9:10:20
than its competitors as you've pointed out but that's internal justification now whether or
9:10:26
not this actually is the truth once again as some people
9:10:32
think that this is sort of rigged they've been better than competitors because the competitors haven't given a
9:10:37
fair chance of competing but only this is sort of talking about the justification of our
9:10:42
acceptance of science the pragmatic justification on continuation of reliance in science
9:10:50
but now as you point out this is one question about the justification of science the other issue is justification
9:10:56
from within what kind of procedures one could use to come to some particular
9:11:02
desirable or reasonable or what he would say warranted outcome of inquiry this
9:11:07
interconnection with formal rules contextual factors in his formulation of
9:11:13
a view of scientific method he rejected what he saw as being the
9:11:18
the most common of all the predecessor theories and on at least one occasion he designated that as the spectator view of
9:11:25
knowledge he said that western man had made one fundamental error for hundreds of years in his philosophy by thinking of man as
9:11:34
a spectator on the world the world is something that we look at that we observe
9:11:39
and through our observations we acquire knowledge of it that whole model said dewey is entirely
9:11:45
misleading because we are not spectators we're agents we are biological organisms
9:11:51
living in an environment in which we've got to survive knowledge is just about the most
9:11:56
important and useful single tool for survival that we have in this situation
9:12:02
because it confers understanding of our environment and that confers a certain degree of mastery of the environment so
9:12:08
we're not spectators at all we're in amongst it having to act all the time on the basis of beliefs right or wrong or
9:12:16
imperfect or inadequate as they may be and it's in that situation that we're
9:12:21
trying to acquire understanding and knowledge and proceeding with our inquiries so he his whole
9:12:28
view of scientific method and of the acquisition of knowledge and the growth of knowledge was seen from the
9:12:34
standpoint not of a spectator an observing subject as previous philosophers had so frequently said but
9:12:41
from the standpoint of an agent wasn't it well a great a great number of themes and do
9:12:46
we are captured by your analysis but a lot of these themes are not really
9:12:52
thesis about knowledge it's also theses of how one understands a particular
9:12:59
as i say a human being naturalistically it's to avoid certain kind of dualisms
9:13:04
that one could sort of think there's a mind and a body and one looks for their interconnections and it turns out
9:13:11
actually to be very very naturalistic humans are organisms one learns about
9:13:16
human organisms in terms of how they act and interact with the world and he's always given this
9:13:23
in action and transaction that's part of dewey's general philosophical anthropology if one wants to look uh
9:13:29
terms part of this quasi-behavioral analysis of mental concepts
9:13:34
and also part of the notion is one has to look for institutional factors or the culture
9:13:41
in which one lives to explain certain kinds of judgments and to explain why certain kinds of perceptual judgments
9:13:47
are made and also in relationship to theory of knowledge she wants to get away from
9:13:52
another kind of picture that's frequently been associated with the pragmatist namely that men are primarily
9:13:59
acting and reacting on the world and trying to improve it and he wants to say no and he gives lots of theories lots of
9:14:07
theses to show how knowledge sort of comes under special circumstances whether the
9:14:12
demand of inquiry comes about it's not that we're always inquiring to use a loose phrase we're in the world in all
9:14:18
sorts of ways and do we try to specify it when it comes to actual knowledge dewey isn't interested in a general
9:14:23
analysis of knowledge he says the word knowledge is used in all sorts of ways
9:14:28
but what he's interested is the specific sense of knowledge what he thinks is the reasonable one namely how one acquires
9:14:36
warranted beliefs as a result of inquiry and he thought that's the aim of knowledge to get warranted beliefs and
9:14:43
to get warrant beliefs as a result of inquiry especially when there's a need for revision of beliefs
9:14:49
now secondly he wants to get away from this view which you call the spectator theory
9:14:54
of knowledge in another sense of the spectator theory of knowledge and namely that belief has certain kinds of objects
9:15:01
knowledge has other kinds of objects and that if we can get certainty
9:15:06
we can't sort of have certainty about these specific objects which are sort of transitory and if we're going to get
9:15:12
knowledge which is certain we have to get a knowledge by by being sort of suitably cognitively
9:15:19
related to a certain kind of entity so this is he thinks this is sort
9:15:25
of an approach that lots of people had which he's debating against he's also debating against the view that somehow
9:15:32
one can jump out of our particular conceptual scheme and to judge our conceptual scheme to see whether sort of
9:15:38
matches in independent realities a moment ago when you were talking about jury and science um you had
9:15:45
something to say about his view of the importance of the institutionalized of science and the institutionalization of
9:15:52
inquiry and in fact dewey one striking characteristic of julie as a philosopher
9:15:57
was that he attached very special importance to institutions generally because he regarded all pursuit of
9:16:03
knowledge as really essentially a species activity an almost biologically based species activity and he also
9:16:10
thought in the special case of science that one reason for the great success of science was its institutionalization of
9:16:17
criticism so he had a lot to say about institutions in general and their role in society now
9:16:24
his philosophy had a great impact on institutions didn't it and in particular i mentioned right at the beginning of
9:16:30
this program he had a special impact on educational institutions throughout the
9:16:35
world not only in the united states can you draw our discussion to a close by just telling us something of what
9:16:42
dewey's impact was on education in his own time and subsequently
9:16:48
well he approached the his approach to institutions as you
9:16:53
pointed out was sort of multi-layered and he frequently thought that
9:16:58
given institutions are frequently justified by certain kinds of let's say ideologies and they're frequently
9:17:04
justified by certain assumptions about what humans are and he thought a lot of the
9:17:10
actual justifications could not actually be uh warranted the pictures they give
9:17:15
of man are actually pictures of man as they are under those current situations
9:17:21
and not as a picture of what man could be secondly they're frequently in the justification the picture of man that
9:17:27
certain institutions provide are in a sense circular because there are pictures of man as he is living within
9:17:33
those institutions secondly that a lot of people believe that you can only justify
9:17:39
claims for institutional arrangements by actually
9:17:44
seeing whether or not these things ultimately rest on sort of value questions and one has to prove
9:17:50
that these particular value judgments are ultimate and et etc he tries to
9:17:56
well this is part of his general theory of ethics in which he wants to show the continuity between justification and
9:18:02
ethics and justification and morals he was always against the view that there was a dualism between fact and value
9:18:09
and send the role of philosopher is to criticize some of these particular kinds of doctrines and secondly try to have
9:18:17
something to say about the concrete institutional arrangements that were made at that time and so
9:18:23
what he does in this book a number of his book is take for granted which book you have democracy in education
9:18:29
and previous writings that's the classic uh is to take for granted that a theory of education should be contextually
9:18:36
irrelevant that though there are invariant features of human life there's no unique
9:18:42
best way of organizing them and the problem is to rationally discuss what institutional requirements are necessary
9:18:49
under these specific conditions now so part of the criticism of traditional philosophies along of
9:18:55
education was that the frequently justified and dubious psychological assumptions the frequently justified and
9:19:01
dubious meta-ethical things of how things could be justified and he then
9:19:08
introdu shows and athletes to his particular kind of satisfaction that those are previously used to justify
9:19:14
certain claims about education also based on sex dubious psychological theories about effort about emotion
9:19:22
about discipline and doing those he introduces his own
9:19:27
positive theories as to how discipline comes from being involved in the
9:19:32
activity rather than necessarily the reverse he was a pioneer opponent wasn't he of the old-fashioned idea of
9:19:38
education that saw it as something imposed on the child by discipline by
9:19:43
almost force major from without and saw the essence of education as being something that had to go along
9:19:50
with the growth and development of the child had to be from within had to have the child's interests and energies so to
9:19:57
speak flowing with it and working for right thank you very much professor morgan besser
A. J. Ayer on Frege, Russell, and Modern Logic
9:20:04
a great deal of the philosophy that's going on today in the english-speaking world in fact probably most of it can be
9:20:09
traced back through intermediate developments to the work of two men gottlob frega and burton russell working
9:20:16
for the most part independently of each other they laid the foundations of modern logic
9:20:21
but more than that although the work on which they began concerned chiefly the principles of mathematics and the
9:20:27
relationship between mathematics and logic its implications went so wide that in
9:20:32
the course of time it came to have a profound influence on philosophy in general
9:20:38
exactly the same happened with the philosopher who most obviously and directly followed on from them namely
9:20:43
wittgenstein wittgenstein started by developing russell's and freyja's work in
9:20:48
mathematical logic but he ended up acquiring an influence at large on 20th century philosophy which is second to
9:20:54
nobodies in this program without going into any of the technicalities of mathematics or
9:21:00
logic i want to give some indication of how frega and russell came to have this enormous influence on 20th century
9:21:07
thought and to say a little about some of the more recent individuals and groups who've come under that influence
9:21:13
but first a word about the individuals themselves frega a german was born in
9:21:18
1848 and spent his entire working life in comparative obscurity in the
9:21:24
mathematics department of the university of vienna not until after his death did his name
9:21:29
become known at all widely even among philosophers his first major work published in 1879
9:21:35
was called begrift and i'm afraid even the english translation keeps the german
9:21:41
title because there's no satisfactory english for it it means something like the putting of concepts into notation
9:21:48
and we'll begin to see later what that's about his next major work published in 1884 is
9:21:54
called in english the foundations of arithmetic he went on producing important and
9:22:00
original work most notably in 1893 and 1903 two volumes of the projected larger
9:22:06
work called in english the basic laws of arithmetic but it was all of such depth and
9:22:12
difficulty that his work in general remained very largely unknown until bertrand russell drew attention to it in
9:22:19
1903 russell was a totally different sort of person grandson of a british prime
9:22:26
minister from whom he was later by his elder brother to inherit an earldom he was always prominent on the political
9:22:33
and social scene as well as in philosophy in fact a famous public figure all his life
9:22:39
he did a tremendous amount of popular writing and journalism and broadcasting which influenced social attitudes among
9:22:46
successive generations of british people i think this is obscured for many the fact that the true foundations of his
9:22:52
fame as a philosopher lie in contributions to mathematical logic of a highly professional and technical
9:22:59
character he was born in 1872 and lived till 1970
9:23:04
and was politically active almost to the end though the great bulk of his philosophical work was done by the 1920s
9:23:11
here to discuss the work of these two men and some of its influences down to our own day is one of the most famous
9:23:18
philosophers of our time aj air who has written a great deal about russell including the best short introductory
9:23:24
book on russell's work professor let's start with fraga as being the earlier figure when he began
9:23:31
what was it he was trying to do well he was trying to [Music]
9:23:37
make up what he thought well deficiencies in arithmetic he thought that mathematical statements as they
9:23:44
were expressed in his day were not sufficiently precise and that mathematical proofs were not
9:23:50
sufficiently rigorous and so he began by trying to develop a notation the buglish shift he referred
9:23:56
to in which it will come in which this would be remedied and rotation was to show exactly what matter
9:24:03
mathematical statements stated and exactly what their proofs consisted in it was supposed to make it obvious how
9:24:09
one step in the proof succeeded another and this was a deficiency in mathematics at his time applying even to euclid uh
9:24:17
where there were assumptions not made explicit to require for the proofs to be valid wasn't one of the points involved
9:24:23
that every argument including a mathematical proof has to have premises and what those premises are often
9:24:30
creates problems and he tried to show that all mathematics was ultimately derived from pure principles of logic
9:24:37
exactly both he and russell did this and this involved two enterprises first of all
9:24:44
defining mathematical concepts in purely logical one and secondly showing that mathematics or arithmetic anyhow not all
9:24:52
mathematics but arithmetic was deducible from purely logical premises
9:24:57
and this is achieved the first part was achieved fairly simply i think a fairly
9:25:03
simple illustration we'll show how it was done uh if you take let's say any couple let's take
9:25:09
tom and jerry then you can define them as a couple by saying that they are both
9:25:15
members of the set and uh anything which is a member of statistic is identical with one or other of them then you
9:25:22
define the number two as a set of of such sets as a set of couples and you do this for all numbers and there are
9:25:28
certain complications about infinity but in this way you can define a cardinal number in purely logical
9:25:35
terms is what he did and then also by generalizing logic
9:25:41
which had until to be done aristelian logic which had prevailed from ancient times
9:25:47
until 19th century was not holy general he was able to
9:25:52
state uh premises from which most arithmetic was it was inducible it
9:25:58
was shown later by somebody uh by another logician the austrian girdle that in
9:26:04
fact this couldn't be completely done the territory couldn't be completed but that insofar as it could be completed
9:26:09
freyja shared a method of doing it wouldn't it also be true to say that before fraga the laws of logic had been
9:26:16
regarded as laws of thought that's to say has something to do with human mental processes but fraga realized that
9:26:23
that that this couldn't be so that the validity of a proof couldn't depend on
9:26:28
our psychology oh yes this was very important this is one of one of the most important things that prager did and he
9:26:34
began by one of his early works was an attack on a book on arithmetic by a german
9:26:40
philosopher called hussell in which logic was represented as a theory of judgment and this was it was high
9:26:47
resealed by the german idealists and fragrant insisted it was entirely objective nothing to do with with
9:26:54
psychological processes but that the sets in which you reduced numbers were entirely objective things and that
9:27:02
logic was quite independent of wasn't about psychology at all these were objective
9:27:08
truths which of course the mind was capable of grasping they didn't depend upon features of thinking
9:27:15
yeah so the search then becomes in a mathematical proof for what it is that
9:27:20
the proof conveys from step to step that's right that impersonally validates the conclusion
9:27:26
regardless of how we think and this in a way accounts for fraga having a philosophical interest beyond
9:27:33
historically mathematical work because he also developed a theory of of meaning
9:27:38
a theory of meaning which would show how mathematics could be objectively valid
9:27:45
and he talked of of the he tied up the meaning of uh
9:27:52
mathematical statements but it's to be extended to statements in general with the truth conditions with with the features
9:27:59
in them that made them candidates for truth or falsehood i suppose the most uh historically influential distinction
9:28:06
that he introduced was the distinction between sense and reference which has to do with his theory of
9:28:11
meaning and one still hears people constantly referring to this can you explain it yes it's it's fairly it's
9:28:17
fairly complicated the two german expressions are zin which is generally translated since and bedok
9:28:24
which is translated which is in fact the german word for meaning but
9:28:29
by philosophers usually translated as either reference or denotation and the
9:28:35
denotation of a name is the object to which it uh which it names i mean the
9:28:42
denotation of brown mcgee is is you the actual person
9:28:48
whereas the sense of of the name is the contribution
9:28:54
that it makes uh to the meaning let's say if if i
9:29:00
just say tom you have to say to me who's tom and then i say well tommy cern says brother and
9:29:07
all the person who invaded such and such or all the first person the clandestine mountain and in this way i give you a
9:29:13
sense and in this way i enable you to identify him now this distinction becomes important
9:29:20
in certain contexts generally what you care about in the case of a name is what the name stands for and but
9:29:28
there are certain cases where it's important to make a distinction between
9:29:33
uh sense and denotation and one good example would be statements of identity the fraga's own uh favorite
9:29:42
example was that of the evening star and the morning star both of which as you
9:29:47
know uh and but if someone says
9:29:55
the evening star is identical with the morning star amman takes the reference of these two expressions to
9:30:01
be the denotation then he's simply saying venus is venus which is a tautology of no interest whereas in fact
9:30:08
the morning star in the unistar is a mathematical discovery and therefore in this usage what the expressions refer to
9:30:15
is not the denotation not the object but their senses so in other words he he analyzed meaning
9:30:21
into two different components that's right sense and reference yes and a statement may have a sense but not have
9:30:27
a reference well this happens in two ways and uh there could be names
9:30:33
or or nominal expressions like uh present king of france for example which
9:30:40
has a sense but no reference because nobody corresponds to it and also there is the
9:30:47
complicated case of expressions which have a function in in a sentence as
9:30:53
contributing to its making it capable of being true or false
9:30:58
but don't deny anything like predicates uh is is is good it's bad if so answer
9:31:04
which themselves are what you call the complete expressions namely don't
9:31:09
themselves have a reference but contribute to giving the sentence a sense and through its sense of
9:31:16
reference and these distinctions that he introduced and his theory of meaning have in fact had a very widespread
9:31:22
influence in philosophy haven't they they've become very fashionable in recent years that's to say and and there's been a a a change in the
9:31:32
anyhow in england and perhaps through well england and united states to some extent and uh
9:31:37
a change in sort of main concern of philosophy for a very very long time the theory of knowledge was dominant ever
9:31:44
since descartes in in his and his successors in the 17th century
9:31:49
the main concern has been the theory of knowledge uh what we what we can know and how we can know it and how we are
9:31:55
justifying holding the beliefs we do and in recent years this has given way to what sometimes called the philosophy of
9:32:02
logic which is mainly concerned with questions about meaning and here fragas
9:32:08
come into great prominence and for instance my successor as professor of logic at oxford and michael dammit has
9:32:13
voted nearly i mean certainly two large books uh two fragrance works and is
9:32:20
concerned with exploring the implications of fragrance distinctions for a theory of meaning
9:32:25
well michael dammit who i suppose is must be called the leading living commentator on fraga makes enormously
9:32:31
large claims for him doesn't he he says that he's introduced a whole new era in philosophy that he has
9:32:37
de-psychologized philosophy that in the way you just explained he dethroned the theory of knowledge from the center of
9:32:44
philosophy and replaced it with logic and this has changed 300 years of philosophical development well i think
9:32:50
there has been a difference of emphasis but i think that michael exaggerates in two ways first of
9:32:56
all floss has always been concerned with meaning ever since socrates went about saying
9:33:02
what his knowledge what is what his goodness and so on which is a way of asking what what the what the greek
9:33:08
equivalence of these terms meant so there's always an interest in in meaning in in philosophy
9:33:14
and secondly i don't think interest in the theory of knowledge has totally disappeared i think i think that there
9:33:21
are still people who are connected with with concerned with this and in so far as
9:33:27
even in michael dammit's own work the theory of meaning is very much bound up
9:33:33
with uh questions about truth and falsehood this also doesn't entirely take us away from
9:33:39
the idea of knowledge because after all the theater knowledge is concerned with what reason we have to suppose that certain statements propositions are true
9:33:45
or false so i think that that there has been a of emphasis but not the the great break that dammit insists on
9:33:53
before we continue with the more recent applications of fragrance work i want to turn to russell for a moment
9:33:59
when i introduce this discussion i emphasized the fact that fraga worked in isolation throughout almost the whole of
9:34:05
his life and this becomes very important when one starts to consider russell because poor russell spent the first
9:34:11
several years of his life reinventing work that fragra had already done without realizing that he'd done it
9:34:18
didn't he ken so that should make it rather easy for you to explain to us something about
9:34:23
the importance of russell's very early work i don't quite know why you say poor russell because it is quite true
9:34:31
that russell did a lot of work that fraga had done before him but russell also exposed a fatal deficiency
9:34:39
in fraga's system he showed that fraga's system of logic actually contained a paradox it's like
9:34:46
the famous old contradiction of epimenides the christian who said all queens were liars it follows and it
9:34:52
it comes into the category of self-defeating propositions although on the surface it seems to be
9:34:58
trivial it's not trivial because it shows that the underlying argumentation has something wrong with it it does it
9:35:04
shows that one of one of uh fraga's essential assumptions led to contradiction and when and
9:35:11
russell in 19 i think it was in 1903 uh uh conveyed this in a letter to fraga
9:35:17
and fraga's first reaction was not oh i'm wrong you shouldn't be arrogant to reply the whole of mathematics has been
9:35:24
shown to be worthless then he thought this was going too far and he
9:35:30
then managed to put together some sort of answer to
9:35:36
russell's objection but then it was shown only after faker's death in fact by a polished edition that fraga's
9:35:44
answer also uh was untenable it led to contradiction and frag himself never
9:35:49
recalled from this blow after he received after the publication of the regression shift
9:35:55
of the bishop the yes the uh the goodness answer um
9:36:00
you yourself said earlier he never wrote the third volume and he simply came up from 1903 to 1925 his death he never did
9:36:07
anything and this was the result he thought his life's work has been demolished yes so that in fact um
9:36:14
it is very sad story yes and and a tragic story and russell then went on to
9:36:20
meet this paradox in his own way some complicated thing called the theory of types it remains true i had odd to press
9:36:27
this point that that an enormous amount of the of the work that russell had done and spent years over fraga had already
9:36:34
done and russell didn't know yes that is true but it's also true that although fraga did it first and some experts
9:36:41
today think that fragrant did most of it better it was through russell that the ideas actually became famous in
9:36:47
philosophy and influential in philosophy that is true i don't know why it was that fragrance work was so uh neglected
9:36:55
partly because uh for absurd reason that um interest in the new developments of
9:37:02
logic was very much an english thing so therefore fragrance works wasn't taken up in germany
9:37:08
because in germany the psychological mistaken psychological view of logic still prevailed yeah and wasn't taken up
9:37:14
in england simply because of english insularity and and in incompetence in foreign languages
9:37:20
and it was left but russell who had been brought up by german governances and german nurses didn't know didn't know
9:37:25
german but even russell when he got indirectly what happened was that russell and his collaborator whitehead went to a congress in paris in 1903 and
9:37:33
met an italian logician called piano and it was through piano
9:37:39
whose work enormously impressed them and he was working in the same direction with a less efficient system than
9:37:44
fragrance they got to hear a fragra and then russell redfreaker once realized how how
9:37:50
important it was and the result of all this was that the science of logic which had remained virtually static for over 2
9:37:56
000 years since aristotle suddenly exploded into a whole new and enormous
9:38:02
enormous thing through ross mainly through russell and whitehead's principal mathematica which she took
9:38:07
them together about ten oh ten years well russell wrote the principles of mathematics in 1903
9:38:14
where he does recognize fraga i think in the preface and in the appearance he does yes and then then he went on with
9:38:21
his with his tutor at trinity cambridge whitehead to write a free volume worked called principal
9:38:28
mathematica in which he actually tried to do the work of deducing mathematics
9:38:33
from logic and it's full of formulae and and it is it is a stupendous work although
9:38:40
as you rightly said it doesn't uh quite achieve the standards of logical rigor that fragger achieved before it but this
9:38:47
was the one that really uh popularized the subject then all sorts of people took it up and it took from then only test preceded by
9:38:54
leaps and bounds and it's now so to speak a major field of intellectual endeavor throughout the western world in
9:38:59
every university but it's interesting i think also should be mentioned that one of the effects has been not so
9:39:06
much to subdue mathematics to logic which is what fraga and russell wanted but to subdue logic to mathematics and
9:39:14
that the the in recent years uh mathematical logic has become more and more mathematical
9:39:20
and less and has had less and less to do with philosophy in general and even
9:39:26
a disciple fraga like michael damage is more interested in the semantic side of it the theory of
9:39:32
meaning that he has hitherto shown himself to be in the purely mathematical side well unlike fraga russell actually
9:39:38
made the explicit step after he'd done all this work to general philosophy not until he was 40 years old but then
9:39:45
he did and he started producing general works of philosophy can you give us some indication of of of what positions well
9:39:52
it's very odd how how little the two are connected they uh um [Music]
9:39:59
the one place where i suppose they are connected is something that russell called the theory of uh descriptions
9:40:06
there was a puzzle about the meaning of of statements like
9:40:11
the present king of france which didn't denote anything what did you say the present king of france is bald exactly
9:40:17
there is no king of france and didn't know anything and therefore there was a question how it could be meaningful and
9:40:23
there had been philosophers a notable example is there's a german called manong who then
9:40:30
thought that that these things noting what he called subsistent entities and russell thoughts was rubbish and he he
9:40:37
showed a way of translating out such expressions by showing that they in fact
9:40:43
contain covert existence claims getting positive ball which translated
9:40:48
into uh there is one thing that now rules over france and whatever
9:40:54
it is whoever france is bald roughly and this uh got rid of the of the apparent
9:40:59
paradox and so in that way his logical work had a result of implication but in
9:41:05
the main he simply went off from another attack his first purely philosophical book
9:41:11
came out in 1912 it's called the problems of philosophy it's a home university library book and
9:41:17
in my view still the best introduction to philosophy there is because russell's a marvelous writer though it's a little
9:41:23
bit old-fashioned and there he really takes no account of his logical work at all he simply continues the british
9:41:29
imperialist tradition this is a book that follows straight on from barclay loch barclay and hume and it starts off
9:41:36
with the theory of our perception it's very like barkley there it says that what we perceive are not tables and
9:41:42
chairs and things but what barclay what lock called simple ideas what uh russell
9:41:47
following his friend moore called sense data and then deals with the old traditional philosophical question how
9:41:54
on the basis of being presented with these sense impressions do we arrive at physical objects and then he deals with
9:42:01
a set of traditional philosophical problems in in that sort of way and
9:42:07
he more or less gave up logic uh
9:42:12
mathematica he himself said that this wore him out
9:42:19
he collaborated in the book on the book with whitehead but whitehead was teaching mathematics at
9:42:25
cambridge and mainly occupied with that russell at that time was living uh independently well he had a lectureship
9:42:31
but cambridge from 1915 but in the first decade of this century he was living on his independent income and so he had the
9:42:39
actual work of writing out all these proofs and he said that this really um
9:42:45
incapacitated him for ever doing any detailed work in future and this is some extent true
9:42:50
all his later work is full of brilliant ideas he never he never fully works out
9:42:55
at a certain point he gets bored he says yes it goes on like this so he doesn't bother to dot the eyes and and cross the
9:43:01
t's and this is true of what is there to work i think that i see one very important continuing concern in the
9:43:07
later work i'd be interested to know if you agree with this or not you've just said i'm sure rightly that that russell
9:43:12
was a a radical empiricist in the direct tradition of lock and human uh it seems to me that russell was
9:43:18
always concerned to validate the natural sciences in terms of sense data that he
9:43:25
always wanted to show that the whole corpus of our scientific knowledge could be derived from and was derived from
9:43:32
nothing but observations and our reflections on our objectives well not
9:43:37
always uh i think you make one very important important point here and one in fact
9:43:43
that i overlooked when i was uh talking a few moments ago and that is that from the very beginning
9:43:49
russell's approached his philosophy was an interest in justification this is
9:43:54
quite an amusing story that when he was about 12 his elder brother who sent the school russell was taught
9:44:00
at home the elder brother frank which was sent to school taught russell geometry and
9:44:06
russell refused to accept the axioms he wanted to have them proved and his brother said that
9:44:11
they couldn't get on unless they keep russell accepted the accident so he agreed to provisionally but he always
9:44:16
wanted just to have everything justified and this was common both in his approach to
9:44:21
logical mathematics and his approach to other branches of knowledge and as you say also in his approach to science he
9:44:27
wanted to have a basis for our belief in science and but here his views varied in the
9:44:36
book i uh mentioned problems of philosophy it's quite true he wanted to start with sense data but
9:44:43
he didn't think that all scientific or even all common sense statements labels like out of the table can be could be
9:44:49
reduced to sensory statements he adopted a causal theory that you could
9:44:56
assume the existence of the physical world as the best explanation for our sensory experiences
9:45:02
then he changed his view and in the next important book that he published on the theory of of knowledge which was
9:45:09
our knowledge of the external world which came out in 1914 he did take the view you just you
9:45:17
just referred to namely he thought you could actually reduce every not only every common sense
9:45:22
statement but every scientific statement to statements about our actual and
9:45:28
possible hypothetical sense experiences and this this this
9:45:33
view which is technically known as phenomenalism and was the view of of uh barclay if you rob barclay of god and
9:45:42
also the view of john stuart mill who was incidentally russell's godfather lay god father because then because i
9:45:48
don't believe in god and not believe in god but he's a godfather
9:45:54
this phenomenalistic view was developed in arnold's external world and also in some
9:46:00
important essays that russell wrote in a book called mysticism and logic which he produced during the first world war an
9:46:07
essay called something like sensator and physics is the most important one there
9:46:12
and he continued this in another important book called the analysis of mind which came out i think
9:46:20
in 1921 and he adopted a theory which had been advanced before him by the pragmatist
9:46:26
william james henry james's elder brother in which both mind and
9:46:32
matter were composed of what james called neutral stuff and which where in
9:46:38
fact uh sense data and images and then they differed only in being different
9:46:44
arrangements this fundamental data but then russell gave this up and in 1925
9:46:50
we'll 95 is the curious book it doesn't matter uh where he well the traces of this is still remaining but he mainly
9:46:56
went back to the causal theory that that he'd held in 1912
9:47:02
and when he revived his interested philosophy in the uh 1940s and in his
9:47:08
final or his next last philosophical book uh
9:47:13
human knowledge and scope and limits he goes back to a causal theory he always he always thought that the basis of our
9:47:19
knowledge uh was laying in in sense experience but he varied
9:47:27
uh in [Music] in the next step i mean he
9:47:32
was only during one period of his work that he thought that the whole thing could be uh reduced to sensory terms uh
9:47:40
more often and certainly in the la at the end of his life very vehemently he he adhered to the causal theory which
9:47:46
put the physical world beyond alveolar observation one thing that is constant
9:47:52
with russell um is the attempt to bring a wholly new rigor to bear in the
9:47:57
philosophy not only of a logical kind but once tempted to say of a scientific kind he was always
9:48:04
very concerned for example that our beliefs should relate to the evidence for them this is something he reiterated
9:48:09
over and over again isn't it and it's something which if taken seriously sweeps aside a great deal of traditional
9:48:16
philosophizing and traditional thinking oh yes that i think is true and i think that this you already
9:48:22
mentioned that uh russell had been frozen indeed wittenstein was
9:48:28
russell's uh people and [Music] as
9:48:34
you know wittenstein and also that group of philosophers in vienna called the inner circle condemned what they call
9:48:41
metaphysics and metaphysics in their view was uh existed at least partly in
9:48:46
any attempt to describe the world in non-scientific terms they thought that this
9:48:52
was the only world there is and that science can was a method of forming
9:48:58
theories about it which were verified by observation and any assumption that was
9:49:03
superior world or world inhabited by gods or anything of that sort was nonsensical and russell certainly all
9:49:10
the time held this and was always concerned to just write science and was always worried by the
9:49:18
fact he thought the justification for science was extremely problematic yeah i mean and it remained problematic to the
9:49:23
end to the end i mean and in the interesting in in the last book that he wrote human knowledge the one i referred
9:49:29
to he then sets out what he thinks are the set of assumptions that require
9:49:35
to be made if belief in scientific theories is to be justified and makes it
9:49:41
quite clear do you think this is these assumptions must as well be taken on faith yes and
9:49:48
he tried to work out what we call a theory of induction but was never entirely satisfied with it and and more
9:49:54
or less said well i remember what he said he said that um we really can't be sure science is true but it has a
9:50:01
greater chance of being true than anything else that could be survivors it's rival yes though he still couldn't
9:50:07
validate it in the way he couldn't validate the way he would like to like let's just talk now in an orderly way
9:50:13
about the influence of russell because he and wittgenstein i suppose must be
9:50:18
the two most influential philosophers in the 20th century at least in the english-speaking world now i suppose
9:50:25
russell's first great influence was on his immediate contemporaries and indeed older
9:50:30
contemporaries like whitehead and muah in the in the cambridge of his young day
9:50:36
um let's put it this way in in the purely uh
9:50:41
logical work in which russell wright had collaborated it was i think russell who
9:50:47
had the more interesting ideas i mean i think the theory of types and their descriptions uh came from russell but
9:50:54
when it came to trying to apply that sort of technique to philosophy which certain extent russell did uh in on also
9:51:00
the external world for example in trying to reduce abstract uh concepts like
9:51:07
concepts of points and instance uh to observational terms then it was
9:51:12
whitehead who took the lead and russell got his ideas for white head indeed they quarreled over this because russell
9:51:18
didn't pay where i take sufficient acknowledgement you'll find that they're developed in two books of writing that came out after the war the principles of
9:51:25
natural knowledge and the concept of nature and russell at one time
9:51:30
was influenced by mctaggart who was the disciple of hegel and got russell to be both russell and moore
9:51:37
to be and to be idealists and muah first of all rebelled against this in the interest of common sense moore's great
9:51:44
defender of common sense and the influence russell to the extent that he that he uh cured russell already
9:51:50
believed in idealism so that the influence went that way also with respect to ethics which was never
9:51:57
greatly interested he accepted like all bloomsbury he accepted moore's principal ethical he believed that good was a
9:52:02
non-natural and definable concept
9:52:08
but then russell had a very big influence on the later or my generation of philosophers
9:52:16
in as much as he convinced us that since science was sovereign in the
9:52:21
description of the world all philosophy could do was elucidate and analyze and
9:52:26
so russell can be regarded i think as the father of analysis but here he differs profoundly from
9:52:33
wittgenstein uh i don't want to go too too deeply to wickenstein but well i i'd
9:52:38
rather you didn't because we're going to devote the whole of the next thing that will come out in our next program is that wickenstein thought that
9:52:44
philosophy was largely a matter of people be getting into a model and the business of people like wikishine was to
9:52:51
as his own famous phrase show the fly the way out of the fly bottle to kill people these models well russell always
9:52:58
thought that philosophical problems had a solution and that was why he was so very hostile
9:53:04
to the purely linguistic philosophy that developed for example at oxford after the war under the leadership of
9:53:10
of austin because he thought this was the the mere explanation of language for its own sake
9:53:15
the the exploration of the implications of english usage was trivial
9:53:21
and russell really thought there were questions about justification of our beliefs that um it was the business of
9:53:28
philosophy to answer and that these questions were answerable he thought that the answers could be discovered if
9:53:34
you worked it hard enough otherwise you didn't think philosophy was worth doing i don't yet i agree with this yes i'm going to say i want to put a personal
9:53:39
question to you because you all your life you have acknowledged that you yourself have been enormously influenced
9:53:45
and you make that very clear and always have so you can tell us what it's like from the
9:53:50
inside as it were to have been influenced by russell what has its influence been on you on me uh
9:53:58
it's been first of all that unlike most of my contemporaries i still think one
9:54:03
should start with what russell calls sense data what i now prefer to call sensualia that
9:54:09
is a technical difference whether you begin with particulars or or or something more
9:54:16
general um but for our present purposes it comes from the same thing so that on the whole i i
9:54:23
share his um uh certainly the starting point of his who's on perception
9:54:29
i share him i also agree with the importance the primacy he attaches to the theory of knowledge
9:54:35
i uh am and therefore i've always been a thunder going empiricist i agree with
9:54:43
the view that russell derived from hume there's no necessity of the logical necessity
9:54:49
so that there's no such thing as causal sensitivity causal is just a matter uh what hume originally said it was namely
9:54:57
constant conjunction and something purely contingent i agree with russell in rejecting any form of theology or anyhow
9:55:05
transcendent theology and injecting metaphysics and i also and most importantly agree with russell that
9:55:10
philosophy wouldn't be worth doing unless it posed questions to which we could find the answers perhaps not he
9:55:16
perhaps not i but cleverer persons than i will eventually find the other and all these are examples not just of your
9:55:22
agreeing with him but of him having influence oh yes are they all of them quite directly yes quite directly quite
9:55:27
directly and i think you've even been influenced by him in the way you write haven't you that appears well i do regard him as a master of english and
9:55:34
well i think i'm not in the same class as russell as a philosopher but i do think that i do write
9:55:39
english reasonably well and i do think and again partly under his influence and in game part and his influence yes i
9:55:45
think there is affiliation both ideas and of style uh from hume through mill
9:55:51
uh uh to russell and coming down a stage to me yeah now the the philosophers that we're
9:55:58
discussing here fraga and russell have enormous effect on the living yourself included
9:56:04
now i now want to talk about the revival of interest in fraga after the second
9:56:09
world war so that the interest in fraga and the interest in russell for the first time proceed side by side into the
9:56:16
age that we now live in it's very difficult to account for historical events
9:56:22
particularly in such short perspective and the i think the in the
9:56:27
there was certainly was in immediately after the war a decline in russell's influence in england
9:56:34
and this was i think not due to a revival of interest in fraga but to uh
9:56:41
an increased importance attached to the work of wittgenstein and moore in moore's case though i enormously like to
9:56:48
respect him as a man i think philosophically it was excessive and i think this was two people responsible
9:56:54
for this were partly not so much rail who respected russell but mainly austin who uh was the
9:57:00
linguistic philosopher in narrowest possible sense and had a great respect for more as as
9:57:07
someone who attached great importance to ordering these users into common sense and so on common sense was said by
9:57:12
russell and that will be the metaphysics of savages and i think it was the upgrading of more uh that was
9:57:19
responsible for at that time for the downgrading in brussels and this is a trend that's now been reversed i'm glad to say i i think you go a bit too far in
9:57:26
saying russell was downgraded because if one thinks back to those post-war years and thinks now who were the major
9:57:31
philosophers in the english-speaking world the shortest of short lists would have to include apart from russell
9:57:37
himself wittgenstein karl popper quine gilbert ryle yourself and all of you
9:57:43
were massively influenced by russell yes perhaps perhaps i'm i
9:57:50
i mean yes so you would know better than i because you after over up at oxford in in in the 50s when i had already
9:57:56
departed um uh for for london but my certainly the impression reaching us in london who was
9:58:03
that russell's being under narrative that means you're taking an oxford-based view and i think that's what's mistaken about the view right i think there were
9:58:10
other people around then who disparaged russell it's perfectly true yes but their work and their influence
9:58:19
and i certainly russell has has uh recovered he himself yeah perhaps i'm influenced
9:58:24
by the fact that he himself thought this yeah because i was seeing a great deal dealing with him at the time i i
9:58:30
organized a group in london that he attended and he was certainly uh miffed
9:58:35
is perhaps too mild a word um but he thought that that he that he wasn't getting his due
9:58:41
and all losses are slightly vain and and he this certainly caused him pain but we
9:58:46
agree in any case that that he's come back he's come back certainly yes now um the revival of fraga is something that i
9:58:54
really i think i'm can't explain i don't even know exactly how it happened probably
9:59:02
it started in america with the development of a school of
9:59:07
logicians led by a man called alonzo church who insisted on very great rigor
9:59:12
in logical mathematics and found it in fraga and didn't find it in in russell and whitehead though of course they did
9:59:18
find it elsewhere they found it for example in hilbert they disagree with hillary for other reasons and in england it seems to have been
9:59:27
the first evidence i can find of it is in a book published fairly late about 1960 i think by
9:59:34
william and martha neal which is a very impressive history of logic in which
9:59:40
which very great importance is given to fraga he's put on a level with aristotle these are two great names and
9:59:47
i've jumped over one thing you suddenly remind me there was a translation in the early 50s in 1950 itself 950 itself was
9:59:55
made by austin of fraga's gundlagon
10:00:00
and then there was also a translation made two or three years later by
10:00:06
max black an englishman living working in america and by peter giech
10:00:12
of two of fraga's very obscure but important semantic essays one of them
10:00:17
called sense and reference and the other called function concept and so there was
10:00:23
in the early 50s this sudden interest in fraga but i'm not quite certain what led to it
10:00:28
or indeed what consequences it had well a lot of very bright younger people took it up didn't they and were influenced by
10:00:35
it whether that'll last or not i don't know but it certainly seems to me to have been going on recently i find very
10:00:40
little influence of fragra in current philosophical work apart from the work of dammit if you if you look at the
10:00:47
example i think now perhaps some of the most interesting work being done is being done in america and if you
10:00:53
look at the work of people like quine and and putnam and and thomas nagle and uh
10:01:00
and donald davidson in particular you don't find so strong influence of fragra
10:01:06
except perhaps in davidson's case indirectly through the work of
10:01:13
the polish tradition tarsky on truth which says links up with fragrant as much as fraga linked himself linked
10:01:19
meaning and truth are you confident that the influence of russell will last
10:01:24
uh yes you are why why so because i think because that because that is who i think
10:01:30
of philosophy i think that the questions he asked are the important philosophical questions and i think that
10:01:37
his answers to them whether right or wrong will always need to be taken into consideration and if i'm
10:01:43
right about you too you also think that his approach to his conception of what philosophy is
10:01:48
is the right conception yes that it consists of clarification therefore analysis and justification
10:01:55
therefore argument of our important beliefs written in straightforward english prose oh well
10:02:02
obviously english was written in in straightforward praise and straightforward prayers yes thank you
10:02:08
very much professor in philosophy as in most other fields of
John Searle on Wittgenstein
10:02:13
human activity the merits of the living are much more controversial than those of the dead
10:02:19
if you took a worldwide poll today among professors of philosophy on the question who is the best living philosopher i'm
10:02:26
pretty sure no candidate would get an overall majority so any list of the so-called great
10:02:31
philosophers can only end with the latest of the generally acknowledged dead and today for us that is
10:02:38
wittgenstein ludwig wittgenstein was born in vienna in 1889 his father from whom he was to
10:02:45
inherit a fortune was the biggest steel magnet in austria wittgenstein was fascinated by machinery
10:02:52
from boyhood and his education was strongly weighted in the direction of mathematics physics and engineering
10:02:59
after studying mechanical engineering in berlin he spent three years at manchester university as a postgraduate
10:03:06
student in aeronautics during this period he became absorbed in fundamental questions about the nature
10:03:12
of mathematics bertrand russell's book principles of mathematics inspired him to give up
10:03:19
engineering and go to cambridge to study the philosophy of mathematics under russell himself
10:03:24
he soon learned all that russell had to teach and went on to do the original research that was to produce his first
10:03:31
book the tractatus logico philosophicus published in 1921 and usually referred
10:03:37
to just as the tractatus wittgenstein genuinely believed that in
10:03:42
this book he had solved the fundamental problems of philosophy so he turned away from philosophy and did other things
10:03:49
meanwhile the tractators acquired enormous influence stimulating further developments in logic at cambridge and
10:03:56
on the continent becoming the most admired text among the famous group of logical positivists known as the vienna
10:04:02
circle but wittgenstein himself came to feel that it was fundamentally an error so he
10:04:08
went back to doing philosophy after all in 1929 he returned to cambridge where
10:04:13
in 1939 he became professor of philosophy during this second period at cambridge
10:04:20
he developed a completely new approach quite different from his earlier one during the rest of his life its
10:04:25
influence spread only through personal contact since apart from one very brief article he published nothing more before
10:04:32
his death in 1951. however in 1953 his book philosophical
10:04:38
investigations came out posthumously and proved to be the most influential work
10:04:43
of philosophy that's appeared since the second world war at least in the english-speaking world
10:04:48
so here we have a most remarkable phenomenon a philosopher of genius producing two incompatible philosophies
10:04:55
at different stages of his life each of which influenced a whole generation
10:05:01
these two philosophies although incompatible do have some basic features in common
10:05:06
both are focused on the role of language in human thinking and human life and both are centrally concerned to
10:05:13
demarcate between valid and invalid uses of language or as someone once put it to
10:05:19
draw the lines at which sense ends and nonsense begins
10:05:24
for me the earlier of wittgenstein's two main books the tractatus remains hauntingly readable but it has to be
10:05:32
said that it's the later one the philosophical investigations that has made him a cultural figure of
10:05:37
international significance during the period since his death here to discuss wittgenstein's work with
10:05:43
me is john soh professor of philosophy at the university of california in berkeley professor cell since
10:05:49
wittgenstein himself repudiated his early philosophy and since in any case it's now the later philosophy that's far
10:05:56
and away the more influential i don't think we ought to spend too much of our discussion on the early work what is it
10:06:02
about that that we really need to know well i think the key to understanding the tractatus is the picture theory of
10:06:09
meaning wittgenstein felt that if language was to represent reality if
10:06:15
sentences were to represent states of affairs then there had to be something in common between the sentence and the
10:06:21
state of affairs and he saw the way to describe that on the analogy with the way that pictures represent states of
10:06:28
affairs he thought there had to be some structural similarity that just as the sentence was made of a sequence of words
10:06:36
that stood for things names so the arrangement of words in the sentence
10:06:41
pictured or mirrored the arrangements of objects in the fact now this gave him a a remarkable sort of
10:06:49
lever of a metaphysical kind where he could then read off he thought the structure of
10:06:54
reality from the structure of language because he thought that the structure of reality had to
10:07:01
determine the structure of language unless language mirrored reality in some way it would be impossible for sentences
10:07:08
to mean so the crucial point here is that we are able to talk about reality not just
10:07:14
because we use words that stand for things but because those words have a relationship to each other within the
10:07:21
sentence that corresponds to the relationship that things have to each other in the world right now so that's
10:07:27
what he called the logical structure right and the world and sentences have that structure
10:07:33
in common right but it's important to emphasize now that we're not talking about ordinary language of the sort that
10:07:38
you and i are discussing which he thought concealed the logical structure he thought if we took ordinary sentences
10:07:45
and did an analysis of how they mean we would get down to the ground floor sentences what he called the elementary
10:07:51
sentences and there there would be this strict picturing relation between the structure of the sentence and the
10:07:57
structure of the fact now he inherits from fraga the idea that the fundamental
10:08:03
unit of meaning isn't the word but the word only functions the name only means
10:08:08
in the context of the sentence and as you said it's the concatenation of the words in the sentence that is itself a
10:08:16
fact that enables the sentence to picture the structure of facts in the world now i think people will see quite
10:08:22
easily how that can be the case when a sentence is picturing a true fact i mean if i say there's a cat on the mat and
10:08:29
there is a cat on the mat i think the that relationship is easily understandable but suppose i say there
10:08:36
is no cat on the mat how can that sort of sentence be said to be picturing something well wittenstein thought that
10:08:43
words like not an and and or and if the so-called logical constants that they
10:08:48
actually didn't picture they were not part of the picturing relationship as he says my fundamental idea is that these
10:08:55
logical constants don't themselves represent their ways we have of stringing pictures together and it's not
10:09:02
so unrealistic if you think about it for example across the street from my house in berkeley there's a little park
10:09:08
and there's a picture of a dog with a line through it now i take it that's not supposed to pick dogs that have stripes
10:09:14
painted on them the the line is the negation sign and that's a it's a wittgensteinian sort of picture that is
10:09:20
the the not symbol there is a way of operating on the picture but it isn't
10:09:25
itself part of the picture so he thought that what we say about the world can be analyzed down into basic sentence
10:09:32
structures basic sentences which picture the world and are linked together uh
10:09:39
or negated by particular operators by so-called logical consciousness the
10:09:44
logical constants which have this function right now in my uh introduction to this discussion i said that
10:09:50
throughout his career wittgenstein was concerned to demarcate talk that made sense from talk that didn't make sense
10:09:58
how was that demarcation done in the early philosophy well in the early philosophy in the in the tractatus
10:10:05
wittgenstein thought that the only language which strictly speaking made sense was this fact stating language
10:10:12
now unlike the positivists he didn't relish that he didn't think that was wonderful he thought that the really
10:10:18
important things were unsayable were unstateable he thought that ethics religion aesthetics were in the realm of
10:10:26
the unsayable and he once said about the tractatus that the really important part of the tractatus is the part that's left
10:10:32
out the part that's not there at all so he he made a strict demarcation of meaningful language as fact-stating
10:10:39
language and the other parts of language those parts of language that are not used to state facts he thought we're
10:10:45
strictly speaking nonsense and we couldn't really say anything although i mean although ethics religion the arts
10:10:52
and so on are fundamental significance in life we can't actually ever do them justice they're in language they are as
10:10:58
far as the tractatus is concerned they are even it isn't that we can't do them justice our attempt to do them justice
10:11:03
is meaningless we can't say anything meaningful about them now you've made the point very clearly that the central
10:11:10
to the early wittgenstein is this picture theory of meaning how did the later wittgenstein depart
10:11:17
from that well again though there vagenstein's ideas are very complex there's a rather simple answer to that
10:11:22
question he moved away from the picture metaphor of the nature of meaning to the tool or
10:11:30
use metaphor as the correct conception of meaning he says think of words as
10:11:36
tools and the way to understand language the way to get a correct
10:11:41
conception of how language function is to look at how words are used he says
10:11:46
for most cases not all but for nearly all cases the meaning of a word is just
10:11:52
its use in the language now this just as the tractatus gave him a certain
10:11:57
metaphysical conception of the world derived from language so by changing from the picture metaphor to the tool
10:12:03
metaphor he turns that metaphysics upside down now instead of saying
10:12:08
that the structure of reality determines the structure of the language now what
10:12:14
he says is that the structure of the language determines what we think of as reality
10:12:20
we can't think of the world we can't discuss the world we can't have a conception of the world independent of
10:12:26
the conceptual apparatus that we use for that purpose now you've raised a lot of very fundamental concepts here and i
10:12:31
think we ought to take them one at a time for the sake of clarity let's let's begin where you began with the
10:12:38
distinction between a picture theory of meaning and a tool theory of meaning the
10:12:43
later wittgenstein is no longer saying that a that that words or sentences
10:12:49
picture what they're about he's saying that a word or a sentence is like a tool and
10:12:54
what it means is what you can do with it so that in fact the meaning of the term is the sum total of its possible uses
10:13:01
now it's in the nature of a picture that it can picture that it does in fact picture only one thing pictures an
10:13:08
object or a state of affairs but it's in the nature of a tool that it has many uses perhaps an indefinite number of
10:13:14
uses now that applies to his view of language doesn't it yes precisely yes yes let me say a little bit more about
10:13:20
that wittgenstein is anxious to insist in the investigations that language is
10:13:25
indefinitely extendable and that there isn't any single thing that binds all
10:13:31
uses of language together that there isn't any single essence that runs through all of language and indeed for
10:13:38
particular words there needn't be any particular essence that marks the
10:13:43
definition of that word that he says words have a a family resemblance of
10:13:49
their uses so that i mean he gives the example of game he says if you ask yourself what is it that all games have
10:13:55
in common and he keeps insisting don't think what they all have in common but look and see if you can find anything
10:14:01
and then he says if you consider board games olympic games gambling games games played with balls on fields and so
10:14:07
on what you find is that there isn't any single essence there isn't any single thing that all
10:14:13
games have in common not even the fact that they are past times or diversions because some people
10:14:18
play them professionally and if you're living in a career if you've been to las vegas it isn't that
10:14:23
those people are are just amusing themselves it's a pretty grim business to watch them at the gaming as they're
10:14:30
called tables but the idea he has is that the strength of the words derives not from some
10:14:37
underlying essence but from the fact that they there's a series of criss-crossing relationships
10:14:43
similarities and he compares that to the way that the various members of a family resemble each other and he calls this a
10:14:49
family resemblance relation now it might seem like wittgenstein was just saying
10:14:54
sort of obvious points here but remember he is militating against a very powerful
10:14:59
philosophical tradition he's militating first against the idea of his own that
10:15:05
words get their meanings by standing for objects and then secondly an even older tradition that says words get their
10:15:12
meanings by being associated with ideas in the head and he's militating against
10:15:17
a tradition that says this goes back to plato that in order for a word to have a meaning there must be some essence there
10:15:24
must be some essential trait that the word marks so the interest of his
10:15:30
remarks about language derives a lot from their uh revolutionary or radical
10:15:35
attack on a pre-existing tradition he uses the term family resemblance so
10:15:40
often that i think it's worth saying just uh a word or two about that uh when we talk of a family the
10:15:46
different members of a family having a marked family resemblance to each other it need not be the case that there's one
10:15:53
single feature that they all have in common they need not be the case that they all have the same nose or all have
10:15:58
the same chin but there's no single feature that they all have in common just an overlapping and criss-crossing
10:16:05
uh a set of features from which they all draw as it were now
10:16:11
wittgenstein is saying that this is true of language and meaning that if we look at a term or a word
10:16:18
it's a great mistake to look for the one thing that it means because there is no
10:16:24
one thing that it means the meaning of a word is like family resemblance in that
10:16:30
case uh namely a word has several different meanings like the several different members of a family
10:16:36
there may be a criss-crossing and overlapping set of relationships between those different meanings but there's no
10:16:42
one thing that the meanings all have in common which is as it were the essence of that word that's really that's that
10:16:49
that's right that's what he says now he doesn't say that this is true for every word in the language no doubt there are
10:16:54
words that have strict definitions but he thought that this was crucial for philosophers to see because a lot of the
10:17:00
words that trouble us especially in philosophy in ethics and aesthetics words like good
10:17:05
and beautiful which he was very suspicious of these words but he thought that our
10:17:11
part of our failure was we were looking for some essence of beauty or essence of goodness whereas he insists just look at
10:17:17
the various resembling crisscrossing similarities in the use of these words so he's saying for example that we have
10:17:24
all sorts of different kinds of talk there's scientific talk religious talk music talk everyday talk philosophical
10:17:31
talk such as you and i and are having and in each of these areas of discourse language is characteristically used in
10:17:38
different ways and the same words will be used in different ways so don't ask
10:17:43
yourself you know what is the specific meaning of this term ask yourself how is this term being used
10:17:50
in that particular area that was one of his slogans don't ask for the meaning ask for the use and at this point he
10:17:56
introduces another metaphor indeed it's one of his few technical terms he
10:18:02
introduced the notion of a language game and the idea he has is that we should
10:18:07
see speaking a language on analogy with playing a game in that
10:18:13
characteristically it's rule governed we aren't ourselves entitled to lay down the rules not everything is determined
10:18:20
by the rules so there is a great deal of slack room for interpretation but nonetheless we're engaged in
10:18:26
rule-governed forms of activity now this again is a disconcerting idea
10:18:31
for a lot of philosophers because he wants to insist that there isn't any
10:18:36
foundation for the language games any more than there's a foundation for football or baseball these are just
10:18:43
human activities and so he wants to get out of the idea that these language
10:18:48
games where the word has its home where words get their meaning from their role in the language games he wants to get
10:18:55
out of the idea that there must be some transcendental justification or foundation for the language game no the
10:19:01
language game has to look after itself we play a language game of ethical discourse of aesthetic discourse a
10:19:08
fact-stating discourse a language game with the word cause a language game of identifying spatial and temporal
10:19:14
relations so he's anxious to insist that there are these sequences and series of human activities
10:19:22
where the use of words is tied up with the rest of our lives in a regular
10:19:27
ordered but not in any way predetermined fashion and that's really the task of the philosopher is to describe not to
10:19:36
justify or give a foundation for but to give just a description of how the language game is played i must say i
10:19:42
think it's something of a disaster that he fastened on this term language game because it sounds as if what he's
10:19:48
talking about is something frivolous and in fact it even uh feeds a certain prejudice against philosophers that
10:19:54
exists outside philosophy that they're all just playing with words or that they're somehow superficially concerned
10:20:01
with uh with language this isn't so at all no i mean he used the word game for serious intellectual reasons right and
10:20:07
let me just hammer home the reasons for the analogy first of all it's an activity it isn't something sublime that
10:20:14
just goes on in our heads uh and it isn't an abstract set of relationships it's an ongoing human activity and sec
10:20:20
secondly it's conventional it's regular there are rules involved and those are the features that he wanted to to get
10:20:27
that we should look at language in action and we should see it as part of regular rule-governed behavior
10:20:33
but there i mean and that sounds i think pretty uncontroversial at least to us
10:20:38
but there is a more radical aspect of this that i want to bring out and that is
10:20:44
fickenstein thought that there isn't any point of view outside of language where
10:20:50
we can so to speak stand back and appraise the language game from a non-linguistic point of view he thought
10:20:57
there wasn't any any archimedean point from which we could get away from operating inside a language game stand
10:21:04
back and appraise the success or failure of language in representing reality he
10:21:09
thought that was impossible we're always operating within the language game we're always operating within some language
10:21:15
game or other there's no conception that we have of appraisal or of getting at the world apart from operating within a
10:21:22
language game part of what he's saying is that for me to be able to see this as a hand
10:21:27
or that as a table i must be in possession of the concepts hand and the table and therefore what i see reality
10:21:35
as being is constituted by a whole conceptual structure that i have
10:21:42
which can be articulated in language that's that is a great deal of it but i think in a way it goes even deeper than
10:21:48
that for wittgenstein wittgenstein really thinks wittgenstein is part of the movement in
10:21:53
the past hundred years it is part of it's a characteristic feature of the 20th century that we no longer can take
10:22:00
language for granted language has become immensely problematic to us and it has
10:22:06
moved into the center of philosophy and wittgenstein is one of the great leaders in that movement so he would certainly
10:22:12
agree with what you just said namely that reality divides up the way we divide it that because we call we we can
10:22:19
only think of this as a hand or that as a table because we've got the relevant concepts the relevant words but the
10:22:25
point is deeper than that the point he wants to make is there isn't any such thing
10:22:30
as thinking there isn't even any such thing as experience as human beings have
10:22:36
adult full full-grown human being experiences that cannot exist apart from language
10:22:43
language permeates that at every point now a moment ago you were saying that every language game has to be understood
10:22:50
from the inside one consequence of this is as follows isn't it whereas uh the old logical
10:22:56
positivists who'd been influenced by wittgenstein's early philosophy were extremely dismissive of
10:23:03
all religious talk for example and they thought that if i said something like god exists that was just meaningless
10:23:09
noise exhaust the later wittgenstein would have not been intolerant in the same way he would
10:23:15
not have dismissed religious talk as being empty of meaning what he would have said is well let's first of all
10:23:22
examine how words are used in a religious concept context how they function
10:23:29
let's look at their use let's as it were get inside the religious language game as he would have put it and see how
10:23:36
these terms are being used and then we can judge whether they're being used legitimately not legitimately or
10:23:42
whatever it might be well you have to be very clear about that last bit you see because what wittgenstein would say is it's not our
10:23:48
task as philosophy to appraise the success or failure of the religious
10:23:55
language game all we can do is describe how it's played and the important thing is to see that it isn't played like the
10:24:01
scientific language game it's ridiculous he thinks that we should take religious utterances as if they were sort of
10:24:08
second-rate scientific utterances for which there was inadequate evidence he was always anxious to insist well we
10:24:14
ought to look at the role that religion and religious utterances play in
10:24:19
people's lives that's the meaning of these utterances to see how what sort of a role they actually play in people's
10:24:25
lives and he he disliked the idea that we should over intellectualize this and make it into some kind of
10:24:31
a theoretical enterprise where what we were concerned to was to criticize this and see if the evidence uh for the
10:24:38
existence of god was up to snuff by scientific standards he didn't like that he looked he w g grace once jumped on a
10:24:45
chair in a meeting and said something wittgenstein really approved of he thought this was wonderful grace said something like this he said
10:24:52
god doesn't want a head any old cabbage will do for a head what god wants is a
10:24:58
heart now vegetarian liked that because he thought that was the language game in action that was not trying to get
10:25:03
outside it and and do some sort of science pseudo-scientific appraisal but
10:25:09
it is important i think was to make the point that he didn't take a sort of anything goes attitude i mean he did
10:25:15
think that philosophical puzzlement is characteristically caused by our
10:25:21
using the terms from one language game as if they belong to another by for example
10:25:28
trying to judge as you i think you just said trying to judge say moral talk or religious talk as if it was scientific
10:25:34
talk and that we got our we having got ourselves into these puzzles and problems the way to get ourselves out of
10:25:41
them was to pay very strict attention to the way the words that we were using
10:25:47
normally functioned no i think that's right an actual human being and he does have various ways that he summarizes he
10:25:52
says philosophical problems characteristically arise when we take the word out of the language game where
10:25:58
it's at home and then try to think of it as something sublime we don't want to inquire into
10:26:03
the nature of the good the true or the beautiful instead of just looking at how these words are actually used in the
10:26:09
language game where they get their meaning a few minutes ago we were talking about this analogy that wittgenstein makes between games and the
10:26:16
use of language there was one important aspect of it that we didn't take up because we can't talk about everything
10:26:22
at once um a game is a rule-governed activity and language is a rule-governed activity
10:26:29
and has to be because if i didn't follow certain linguistic rules what i said would be unintelligible and wouldn't
10:26:35
communicate or perform any of the functions i wanted to perform so i have to follow certain rules
10:26:42
now wittgenstein argued that because that was so there could be no such thing
10:26:47
even in theory as a private language and his argument to this effect has
10:26:52
become one of the most controversial aspects of his philosophy can you say a word yeah it sure is well i i would be
10:26:58
glad to in a way i'm reluctant to get into this hassle because there's so much junk written about the private language
10:27:04
argument but just let me say a little bit about it first of all you got to say something about rules we've been talking as if the
10:27:10
notion of a rule for wittgenstein was unproblematic but it wasn't his notion of a rule is it is itself
10:27:17
one of his important contributions to philosophy what he thought was first of all that rules don't
10:27:25
block off all eventualities that the language isn't everywhere bounded by rules nothing is everywhere bounded by
10:27:32
rules there are always lots of gaps left open by any system of rules he gives the example of throwing a tennis ball when
10:27:38
you serve there's no rule how high you have to throw it but i suppose if somebody could throw the thing five miles high and we had to wait all day
10:27:45
they'd make a rule i mean the rules are never final now another thing he said about rules is
10:27:51
that rules are always subject to different interpretations and if you've ever been through the income tax laws
10:27:57
you know this i mean the american in history of it is a series of different interpretations so it looks to wittenstein as if there's
10:28:04
a kind of skepticism that arises here because if anything can be made to conform to the rule by some fancy
10:28:11
interpretation then anything can be made to conflict with it and you wouldn't get either a cord nor conflict the rule
10:28:16
would then seem to drop out as irrelevant now his solution to that is to say
10:28:22
obeying the rule is a social practice it's something we learn in society
10:28:27
society just has ways of making people and training people to conform to rules
10:28:34
now he applies that to this whole private language problem the problem of the private language is could there be a
10:28:40
language where i just named my own private sensations in a way that no one
10:28:46
else could understand it now the reason for all the fuss is that a lot of people in the history of philosophy has have
10:28:52
thought that must be the basic use of language in the whole cartesian language must name inner experience that we get
10:28:59
to the real world the external world by starting from our inner experiences by starting from inside and working outward
10:29:06
now wittgenstein wants to say two things about that first of all that isn't how the words for our inner experiences
10:29:13
actually function they don't name private objects rather they're used in
10:29:18
conjunction with public criteria behavior situations so we're not in fact
10:29:24
speaking a private language when we use sensation language but secondly and more
10:29:29
controversially he says we couldn't in fact speak a private language we couldn't give a private ostensive
10:29:36
definition where we just sort of point inwardly to some private experience and name that experience because he said
10:29:43
unless we can appeal to some larger social gathering there won't be any
10:29:48
difference between my thinking i'm using the word right and i'm actually using it right so his discussion of the rules and
10:29:56
the and the social character rules is really what underlies his rejection of the idea of a private language and it's
10:30:03
important for him to reject the idea of private language as you say because he's reacting against a whole tradition of
10:30:09
philosophy that goes back to i suppose descartes but certainly includes lots of
10:30:14
the the empiricist philosophers who say that we start by cognition of
10:30:20
essentially private states of mind and infer the world or build up a conception
10:30:25
of the world from that now the later wittgenstein seems to me to be saying this that
10:30:31
because the sum total of a word's possible uses constitute its meaning
10:30:38
in the end what language means and what words mean depend on forms of life
10:30:46
on the social contexts within which they're used and in fact he uses that phrase forms of life a great deal so
10:30:53
that all the ultimate criteria of meaning are not personal are not private at all
10:30:59
they are essentially social are they not that's right and the and the it's
10:31:04
important to emphasize that the notion of use is itself a social notion it's
10:31:10
something that i do in conjunction with other members of a society and it's only because i'm trained to respond in
10:31:17
certain ways that we avoid this skepticism that says well anything i do can be made to seem to be in accord with
10:31:23
some rule or other or i could always interpret the rule in such a way that would come out in accord with it and he
10:31:28
does emphasize the idea that a language is a form of life that we can't sort of carve off the language and look at it
10:31:35
apart from the human activities where it actually has its meaning when people pick up wittgenstein's books to read
10:31:41
them i think they're often struck and surprised straight away by what they find because
10:31:46
these books are not written in the way that ordinary books are they're not written in continuous prose they're
10:31:52
written in separate paragraphs and each paragraph is given a number and very often it's not clear what the
10:31:59
relationship is between a paragraph and the other two on either side of it and usually there isn't much in the way of
10:32:05
connected argument either you get these brilliant metaphors brilliant examples
10:32:10
brilliant similes so that the writing is wonderful and yet it's difficult usually
10:32:17
to see what it is he's saying now why did he write like that well several reasons but first of all i do want to
10:32:22
say i entirely agree with you about the character of the prose and it is both entrancing and exasperating i know i
10:32:29
felt that when i was preparing for this program i went and re-read acres of wittgenstein and there just is a huge
10:32:35
amount and and it is enthralling you you begin to start thinking that way yourself you begin to address your wife
10:32:41
in wittenstein aphorisms which can be very exasperating but also you have this feeling that when you take up one of
10:32:47
these books and and read it it's a bit like getting a a a kit for a model
10:32:52
airplane with no instructions as to how you're supposed to put all these pieces together and that can be extremely
10:32:58
frustrating it's a sort of do-it-yourself book but why did he write like that well first of all i think it
10:33:03
was the only way he found natural i mean he often says what a torture it is for him to try even to put these paragraphs
10:33:09
together consecutively much less to write conventional prose of articles and
10:33:15
books but secondly i think there is an element almost of arrogance in this wittgenstein
10:33:21
wanted it to be different from the standard ways of doing philosophy he hated
10:33:26
the sort of standard articles that appear in journals and standard books that are written to be read by
10:33:32
undergraduates in philosophy by the way he would have hated the kind of thing you are and i are now doing two
10:33:37
professional philosophers discussing his views on television but he did want to be deliberately
10:33:44
different from other people and then there's a third aspect of this is that
10:33:49
he honestly and sincerely was struggling to say something new and different and
10:33:54
he always had the feeling that he hadn't said what he really meant that he was struggling to find a mode of expression
10:34:01
and that he never really succeeded and then lastly i think we need to say for for uh english uh speaking viewers that
10:34:09
this though it looks strange to the english eye to uh see this books written in this way
10:34:16
it's not all that unusual in german there is a tradition in german philosophy of writing aphoristically you
10:34:23
see it in nietzsche uh it's in schopenhauer and lichtenberg just to mention a few
10:34:28
and the writing is that it's best wonderful i think we have to do him the justification he's a great stylist as your great stylist and some of the
10:34:35
sentences stay in your mind for the rest of your life forever after you've read them yes in my introduction to this discussion i
10:34:41
mentioned the fact that in the last i don't know how long one ought to say 10 years 15
10:34:47
years probably not much more than that he has become an international figure of importance
10:34:54
quite outside philosophy when one reads books and articles and journalism that have nothing to do with philosophy one
10:35:00
is beginning now over and over again to come across wittgenstein's name can you say just a little about the
10:35:06
fields outside philosophy in which he is important and indicate at least what
10:35:11
kind of an influence he appears to be having well i'd present i think it's like it's a kind of name dropping it's
10:35:18
an okay name and he's certainly mentioned in a lot of fields but i think he would feel himself that he has not
10:35:23
been adequately understood and indeed has not been adequately understood in philosophy but some of these fields are
10:35:30
literary criticism and aesthetics generally wittgenstein is now often referred to and i think will become more
10:35:35
influential um there is a great deal of mention of wittgenstein in social sciences particularly anthropology
10:35:42
because he thought of himself as doing a kind of anthropology there is a books written about the importance of
10:35:49
wittgenstein for political theory so it's what the the french would call the sciences of man that wittgenstein has
10:35:54
been most influential paradoxically in a way because he wrote so much about the philosophy of mathematics but most of
10:36:00
his influences now are in outside of philosophy are in the society it seems that the structuralists who are so
10:36:05
fashionable or have been fashionable for so long seem to be claiming wittgenstein for their own well it's the
10:36:10
post-structuralist i think they probably misunderstood him the worst structure but that's another program yes yes well
10:36:16
right but then then we won't get into that but i think the point is worth making that uh for example if you read serious literary criticism now you are
10:36:24
going to come across constant reference to wittgenstein what is your personal evaluation of of
10:36:31
all this of wittgenstein as a philosopher well i i feel so strongly about this i've been restraining myself
10:36:36
all along just trying to say what the guy meant and not what i actually think about it but let me start out negatively
10:36:41
and then i get to end on the on the more a cheerful note there is a kind of exasperating feature of wittgenstein
10:36:48
that i want to highlight i want to emphasize and that is the anti-theoretical bent in wittgenstein
10:36:55
the idea that we mustn't have a theory that we can't have a theory of language we can't have a general theory of
10:37:01
language or of the mind now when somebody says to me when some guy
10:37:08
says you can't have a general theory of speech acts or you can't have a general theory of intentionality of how words
10:37:14
how the thought how thoughts relate to reality my natural instinct is to go out and write a general theory we'll just
10:37:21
see if we can't have a general theory and in fact i have tried to make general uh statements in both of these fields i
10:37:28
think it's premature of wittgenstein to say we can't have general theories of language of a philosophical sort or
10:37:34
general theories of how the mind functions we won't know if we don't try and the the sheer diversity of the
10:37:42
phenomena should not by themselves discourages i mean think of physics if
10:37:47
you think of niagara falls and a pot of water boiling and an ice skating rink it looks like very diverse phenomena and we
10:37:54
could go on and on with the diverse forms that water takes but in fact we've now got a pretty good general theory
10:38:00
that can account for all of that and i don't see why we shouldn't seek general theories in philosophy in particular in
10:38:07
the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind i almost think sometimes that
10:38:12
wittgenstein thought since he had failed to get a general theory since the tractatus failed then any general theory
10:38:19
must be impossible roughly speaking if i can't do it nobody can and a lot of people probably what he actually
10:38:25
believes a lot of his disciples have said to me oh well since you reject this anti-theoretical this anti-theoretical
10:38:31
benefit investigation you must believe in the tractatus as if those were the only two options and i want to suggest
10:38:37
there are lots of other options now tied in with this aversion to theory is a kind of waffling
10:38:45
that goes on in certain crucial areas let's take religious discourse just as an example of this we were mentioning
10:38:50
this earlier see wittgenstein himself obviously had a deep religious hunger i mean it wasn't
10:38:57
this sort of um a middle-class english attitude about religion that it's just something for sunday mornings no it he
10:39:04
really had a religious hunger there are these constant references to god and getting himself right with god and yet i
10:39:10
think most people would say that he was an atheist now he in a way you feel almost that he
10:39:16
wants to have it both ways that he wants to be able to say things like well we just need to know the role that
10:39:22
religious discourse plays in people's lives but of course you won't understand that role unless you see that religious
10:39:29
discourse refers beyond that the only reason that people pray is because they think there's a god up there listening
10:39:35
and it's and that's not whether or not god is listening is not part of the language game the language game of
10:39:41
religion can only be played the way it is because people think there's something outside the language game that
10:39:46
gives it sense okay now that's for the bad part let me say what i think is really terrific in wittgenstein
10:39:52
well first of all i think most philosophers what i'm going to say right now is kind of contemporary orthodoxy most philosophers would agree
10:39:59
with this he has made terrific contributions in the philosophy of language and in the philosophy
10:40:04
of mind his contribution in the philosophy of language is that he really mounted devastating attacks on the idea
10:40:11
that words get their meaning by standing for things or by being associated with some
10:40:16
introspective process by standing for some mental thing in the mind and he does knock those views pretty
10:40:23
effectively and also he is pretty good one i think of the most powerful not the
10:40:28
only one but certainly one of the most powerful expressions of the view that speaking a language ought to be seen as
10:40:34
a form of human activity that words are also acts words are deeds and that is an
10:40:41
important line of investigations now in a way his discussion in the philosophy of mind is
10:40:46
just as important as his work in the philosophy of language and it's a very effective attack on the cartesian
10:40:53
tradition on the idea that we really live in two worlds a mental world and a
10:40:58
physical world but his attack on cartesianism is so powerful precisely
10:41:04
because he doesn't mistake the doesn't make the mistake of most anti-cartesians of thinking yeah you
10:41:09
just have to reject the mind just say there isn't any such thing as mental phenomena what he does is a painstaking
10:41:16
analysis of a whole lot of psychological concepts belief and fear and hope and
10:41:22
expecting and he goes through these and what he shows you is that the deep
10:41:27
grammar of these expressions is quite different from what you would think just looking at the surface where we have
10:41:33
nouns like mind and body and where it looks like they're these two different things minds and bodies what he does is
10:41:39
by carefully describing these language games he gets you to see that things like hope and fear and expectation and
10:41:46
belief are grounded in situations that we actually use these words in such a
10:41:52
way where we're not inclined to think there must be some deep cartesian divide
10:41:57
we say things like he's been groaning and in pain for the past two hours and we don't feel there
10:42:03
oh my gosh he's mixed categories the physical groaning and the mental pain it's the perfectly natural way of
10:42:09
talking and he shows us that our natural way of talking does not lead to any kind of cartesianism
10:42:16
however the most powerful part of wittgenstein from my own personal point of view is not his work in the
10:42:22
philosophy of language and mind but it's an idea that really begins to acquire momentum in his last work it also
10:42:29
appears in his earlier work but in his very last work that he wrote when he was dying on certainty and that's it's a
10:42:36
rather subtle idea but it's this we have in the western intellectual tradition going back to plato
10:42:42
we have the idea that any meaningful human behavior must somehow be the
10:42:47
expression of a theory an implicit theory that we hold that if you understand me and i understand you it
10:42:54
can only because we each have a theory of the other as you say an implicit and implicit chomsky thinks this that
10:43:01
there's an unconscious theory of language and artificial intelligence is based on this presupposition that there are these unconscious theories now
10:43:08
there's some truth in that but wittgenstein is anxious to emphasize that a great deal of what we do both is
10:43:15
both socially and biologically primitive it's a way of responding it's
10:43:21
a way of acting we just act we don't need to appeal to the idea that there's
10:43:26
some implicit theoretical structure that enables us to act and he as usual he has
10:43:31
very good similes he says look think of squirrels storing nuts for the winter
10:43:37
now do they do that because they think hume's problem of induction has been solved and we now know that the future
10:43:43
resembles the past no they just do it now he says think of yourself and putting your hand in the fire is the
10:43:50
reason you don't put your hand in the fire is it because you think you've refuted hume or you think you've got very good inductive evidence no you just
10:43:58
don't do it you you couldn't be dragged into that fire and he says a great deal
10:44:03
of our human activity has to be seen like that we're just responding in ways
10:44:08
that are both biologically and culturally conditioned but his ground floor statement he keeps repeating this
10:44:14
is we just act that's the way we do it and this goes against a whole tradition
10:44:19
where we try to think well we can only do what we do because we've got an implicit theory
10:44:25
do you think there's still a lot of juice in this or do you think that wittgenstein himself has made all of the
10:44:31
really important the creative and constructive use of these ideas that can be made oh no i think there's a great
10:44:37
deal more to be said on this i uh to put it very bluntly i think wittgenstein only scratched the surface thank you
