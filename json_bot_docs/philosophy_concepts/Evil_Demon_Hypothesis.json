    "Content": "The Evil Demon Hypothesis is a radical skeptical scenario introduced by René Descartes to challenge the certainty of human knowledge. Descartes imagined a powerful, malicious being—an 'evil demon'—capable of manipulating all our perceptions, memories, and reasoning so that everything we believe about the world could be false. In such a case, even our most basic beliefs about reality, logic, and the external world could be illusions. This thought experiment was part of Descartes’ method of hyperbolic doubt, in which he resolved to question everything in search of a belief that could not be doubted. Ultimately, he concluded that even if the demon deceived him, the very act of being deceived required a thinking subject—leading to his famous statement, 'Cogito, ergo sum' ('I think, therefore I am'). The Evil Demon Hypothesis continues to influence debates in skepticism, the philosophy of mind, and discussions of artificial or simulated realities. Modern analogues include the 'brain in a vat' scenario and the simulation hypothesis, both of which push us to question whether we can ever verify reality beyond our subjective experience."
