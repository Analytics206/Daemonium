    "Content": "Actor-Network Theory argues that humans and non-humans (technologies, objects, institutions) should be understood as equally important 'actors' in networks of relations. Rather than privileging human intentionality, ANT highlights how power, agency, and meaning emerge from the interplay of all entities within a system."
