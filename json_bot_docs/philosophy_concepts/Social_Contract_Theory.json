    "Content": "Social Contract Theory is the idea that societies are formed through an implicit or explicit agreement between individuals and their governing institutions. In this arrangement, people give up some personal freedoms in exchange for security, order, and the benefits of living in a structured community. Without such an agreement, life would be chaotic—governed only by brute force and survival instincts. This concept is central to political philosophy and has been explored by thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Hobbes argued that in a 'state of nature'—a world without laws or government—life would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.' To escape this anarchy, people agree to obey a ruler or governing body, even at the cost of some freedoms. Locke, in contrast, believed the social contract exists to protect natural rights such as life, liberty, and property. If a government fails to safeguard these rights, the people have a moral right to rebel. Rousseau offered yet another perspective, holding that true political legitimacy comes only when people collectively participate in creating the laws they live under. At its core, social contract theory grapples with the balance between individual freedom and societal order. It raises timeless questions: How much control should a government have? What do we owe one another as members of a society? And when, if ever, is it justified to break the contract? These debates remain deeply relevant today, shaping modern discussions on justice, democracy, and human rights."
