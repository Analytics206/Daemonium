    "Content": "Buridan’s Ass is a philosophical paradox about free will, decision-making, and rationality, named after the 14th-century philosopher Jean Buridan. It imagines a donkey standing exactly between two identical piles of hay. Being perfectly rational, the donkey has no reason to choose one over the other, and therefore cannot act—ultimately starving. The paradox highlights a flaw in deterministic decision-making: when all factors are equal, purely rational choice becomes impossible. It raises the question: Is rationality enough for decision-making, or do we need spontaneity, randomness, or free will? This scenario applies to human choices, such as deciding between two equally appealing job offers, and to artificial intelligence, where algorithms must resolve equally weighted options. A proposed solution is introducing an arbitrary tie-breaker, suggesting that randomness, intuition, or external influence is necessary for decisions. Though often playful in presentation, the paradox has serious implications for free will, determinism, and the limits of logical reasoning."
