    "Content": "Logical Positivism is a philosophical movement that asserts only statements that can be empirically verified or logically proven have genuine meaning. Originating with the Vienna Circle in the early 20th century, figures such as A.J. Ayer and Rudolf Carnap argued that claims about metaphysics, ethics, and theology are meaningless unless they can be tested through observation or established through logical or mathematical proof.\n\nAt the core of Logical Positivism lies the verification principle, which holds that a statement is meaningful only if it is either analytically true—true by definition, such as 'All bachelors are unmarried'—or empirically verifiable, as in 'Water boils at 100°C at sea level.' According to this view, statements about the supernatural, morality, or subjective experiences are dismissed as nonsensical or outside the realm of meaningful discourse.\n\nWhile Logical Positivism became highly influential in early analytic philosophy and helped shape the modern philosophy of science, it faced strong criticism for being self-refuting: the verification principle itself cannot be empirically verified or proven through pure logic, and thus fails its own test. This internal flaw, along with evolving philosophical perspectives, led to its decline in the mid-20th century.\n\nDespite its fall from prominence, Logical Positivism left a lasting impact on the philosophy of science, the demarcation problem, and ongoing debates about the nature of knowledge, truth, and scientific reasoning."
