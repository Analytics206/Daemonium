    "Content": "The Prisoner’s Dilemma is a foundational problem in game theory and decision-making that demonstrates how rational individuals may act against their own best interests when mutual trust is absent. It is often presented as a scenario in which two criminals are arrested and placed in separate interrogation rooms, each given the same offer: if one betrays the other while the other remains silent, the betrayer goes free while the silent prisoner receives the maximum sentence. If both betray each other, they each receive a moderate sentence. If both remain silent, they each receive a minimal sentence.\n\nFrom a purely rational, self-interested perspective, each prisoner should betray the other, because betrayal offers the best individual outcome regardless of the other’s choice. However, when both follow this reasoning and betray each other, they end up with a worse outcome than if they had cooperated by remaining silent. This paradox illustrates how individual rationality can lead to collective failure.\n\nThe Prisoner’s Dilemma has far-reaching implications in economics, politics, and psychology, particularly in the study of trust, cooperation, and competition. It explains phenomena such as destructive price wars between businesses, the difficulty nations face in disarmament negotiations, and why individuals often act selfishly even when cooperation would benefit everyone.\n\nThe dilemma underscores the challenge of achieving mutual trust in uncertain situations. It also suggests that cooperation can emerge when participants expect to interact repeatedly over time, as the prospect of long-term relationships shifts incentives toward trust and collaboration rather than short-term self-interest."
