    "Content": "Occam’s Razor is a philosophical principle that suggests the simplest explanation—one requiring the fewest assumptions—is usually the best. Named after the 14th-century philosopher William of Ockham, it is a tool for logical reasoning that warns against adding unnecessary complexity without evidence. This does not mean the simplest explanation is always correct; rather, extra assumptions without proof increase the risk of error. For example, if you hear hoofbeats, it is more reasonable to think of horses rather than zebras—unless you have strong evidence otherwise. Occam’s Razor is widely applied in science, philosophy, and everyday decision-making: in science, it encourages building theories with minimal assumptions, ensuring they are testable and not needlessly complicated; in medicine, it guides diagnosis by prompting doctors to consider common conditions before rare ones. Critics note that simplicity alone does not guarantee truth—reality can be complex, and oversimplifying can miss crucial details. Therefore, Occam’s Razor works best as a heuristic—a guiding principle, not an absolute rule—reminding us to value clarity, evidence, and parsimony over speculation."
