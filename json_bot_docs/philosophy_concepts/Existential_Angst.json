    "Content": "Existential angst is the deep, unsettling feeling of anxiety or dread that arises from confronting the reality of human existence. It is the moment when you realize that life has no predetermined meaning, that the universe is indifferent to your struggles, and that you alone are responsible for creating purpose in your life. This concept is central to existentialist philosophy, particularly in the works of thinkers like Søren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Martin Heidegger. Kierkegaard described it as the 'dizziness of freedom'—the overwhelming realization that, unlike a stone or a tree, you are not bound by an inherent purpose. You must choose your own path, and with that freedom comes the terrifying responsibility of making the right choices. For Sartre, existential angst—or nausea—arises when we confront the absurdity of existence: Why are we here? Why does anything matter? We crave external validation, yet we are ultimately alone in our decisions. There is no cosmic blueprint guiding us, only the weight of our own choices. This realization can be paralyzing. Some try to escape it by clinging to religious dogma, societal expectations, or mindless distractions. But existentialists argue that the only true response is to embrace the freedom to create meaning through authentic living and to act with full ownership of one’s existence. While existential angst can be unsettling, it is also liberating. It forces us to stop waiting for life to happen to us and instead actively shape it. Rather than seeing life’s uncertainty as a curse, we can see it as an opportunity—to define ourselves, to live with intention, and to make every moment count."
