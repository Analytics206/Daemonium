    "Content": "The Infinite Regress Problem arises when an argument, explanation, or justification requires an endless chain of reasoning, making it impossible to reach a secure foundation. This problem appears in epistemology, metaphysics, and logic whenever a claim demands further justification, which in turn requires another justification, and so on indefinitely.\n\nIn epistemology, a common example is the question: 'How do you know X is true?' If the answer is, 'Because of Y,' and we then ask, 'How do you know Y is true?' the process continues endlessly unless a stopping point is found. Without a final justification, establishing knowledge becomes impossible.\n\nIn metaphysics, the 'first cause' problem illustrates this dilemma: if everything must have a cause, then each cause must itself have a cause, leading to an infinite regress. To avoid this, some propose an uncaused first cause—such as God, the Big Bang, or a necessary metaphysical principle—that serves as the ultimate foundation.\n\nPhilosophers have identified three main responses to the infinite regress problem. Foundationalism holds that some basic beliefs or principles are self-evident and require no further justification. Coherentism suggests that beliefs can justify each other in a mutually supporting web, avoiding the need for a linear chain. Infinitism, the least popular view, accepts that justification can continue infinitely without requiring an ultimate foundation.\n\nThe Infinite Regress Problem highlights deep challenges in rational justification, causality, and the nature of explanation. Whether in philosophy, science, or logic, it forces us to confront the question: where, if anywhere, does justification ultimately stop?"
