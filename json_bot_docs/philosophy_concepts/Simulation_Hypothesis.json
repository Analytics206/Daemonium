    "Content": "The Simulation Hypothesis proposes that reality as we experience it may be a highly advanced computer simulation rather than a fundamental physical reality. Philosopher Nick Bostrom popularized the concept by arguing that if technological civilizations advance far enough, they could create realistic simulated worlds containing conscious beings who are unaware they are in a simulation. Bostrom's probability-based argument suggests that at least one of three statements must be true: civilizations never reach the capability to create advanced simulations, they reach it but choose not to run them, or we are almost certainly living in one. If civilizations did create such simulations, they would likely produce many—possibly billions—making it statistically more probable that we are simulated than real. The hypothesis raises profound questions about free will, consciousness, and the nature of existence. It also leads to speculation about whether we could ever escape such a simulation, whether its creator would be a godlike entity, and whether simulated universes could themselves run further simulations, creating an infinite chain of realities. Critics argue that the hypothesis is unfalsifiable, making it scientifically untestable, while others contend it changes nothing practically, since the simulation would still follow consistent rules we call physics. Regardless of its verifiability, the Simulation Hypothesis challenges our most basic assumptions about existence and the possibility that our reality is not what it seems."
