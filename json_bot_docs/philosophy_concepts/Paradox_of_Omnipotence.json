    "Content": "The Paradox of Omnipotence questions whether an all-powerful being can create a task that it cannot complete. The most well-known formulation asks: 'Can an omnipotent being create a rock so heavy that it cannot lift it?' If the being can create such a rock, then there is something it cannot do—lift it—meaning it is not truly omnipotent. But if it cannot create such a rock, there is again something it cannot do—create it—thus challenging the very concept of unlimited power.\n\nThis paradox raises profound questions about the nature of omnipotence, the limits of power, and the boundaries of logical possibility. Some theologians and philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas, argue that omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are logically possible, excluding contradictions such as creating a 'square circle.' Others, including C.S. Lewis, suggest that God’s power does not extend to self-contradictory actions because they are not genuine 'things,' but rather meaningless statements.\n\nThe Paradox of Omnipotence remains central in theology and the philosophy of religion, particularly in debates about whether an all-powerful being can exist without logical contradictions. It compels us to reconsider whether omnipotence should mean the ability to do absolutely anything, or only to do what is logically coherent."
