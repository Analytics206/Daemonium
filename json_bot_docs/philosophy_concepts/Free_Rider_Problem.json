    "Content": "The Free Rider Problem is a well-known issue in economics, ethics, and political philosophy that arises when individuals benefit from a shared resource or public service without contributing to its cost or upkeep. It underscores the challenge of collective action: how to ensure that everyone contributes fairly when there is an incentive to let others bear the burden. Common examples include public transportation funded through taxes, workplace projects where some members do less work, and national defense, where all citizens benefit regardless of their contribution. If too many people free ride, the system becomes unsustainable. The problem is closely related to the Tragedy of the Commons, where overuse of a shared resource occurs, and to game theory scenarios like the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, where self-interest can harm the group. Solutions include taxation, legal obligations, and incentives, as well as reliance on social norms such as peer pressure or moral responsibility. The Free Rider Problem remains relevant in modern challenges like climate change and voter participation, where individual inaction can undermine collective welfare."
