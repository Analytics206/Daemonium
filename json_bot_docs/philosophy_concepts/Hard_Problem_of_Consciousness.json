    "Content": "The Hard Problem of Consciousness, coined by philosopher David Chalmers, refers to the deep question of why and how physical brain processes produce subjective experience. Neuroscience has solved many 'easy problems'—understanding neural mechanisms, perception, and memory—but these deal with function, not feeling. The hard problem asks: Why does sensory processing feel like anything? Why does red have 'redness' and pain have a felt quality? This is particularly difficult for materialism, which sees the mind as purely physical. Could an advanced AI truly have consciousness, or only simulate it? Responses range from emergentist theories, which see consciousness as arising from complexity, to panpsychism, which treats it as a fundamental feature of the universe. Despite decades of research, the problem remains unsolved, with implications for free will, AI, and the nature of reality."
