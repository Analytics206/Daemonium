    "Content": "The Veil of Ignorance is a thought experiment proposed by philosopher John Rawls to determine what a truly fair society would look like. It challenges us to design a just system without knowing where we personally would end up within it. Imagine that before you are born, you stand behind a 'veil of ignorance' that hides your future identity. You do not know whether you will be rich or poor, male or female, healthy or disabled, part of the majority or a marginalized group. Since you have no idea where you will land in society, you must create rules that are fair for everyone. Would you design a world where the rich have all the power and the poor suffer, if there’s a chance you might be born into poverty? Would you allow discrimination, knowing you might end up in the group being discriminated against? Rawls argued that under these conditions, rational people would choose principles of justice that ensure fairness for all. They would prioritize basic freedoms, equal opportunities, and protections for the most vulnerable—since they might end up among them. This leads to his idea of 'justice as fairness': a system that does not favor any particular group, but seeks to create an equitable society for everyone. The veil of ignorance remains a powerful tool for thinking about ethics and policy. It forces us to step outside personal bias and consider fairness from a truly neutral perspective. Today, it is widely applied in debates about economic inequality, healthcare, human rights, and social justice—offering a simple yet profound way to evaluate the fairness of any system."
