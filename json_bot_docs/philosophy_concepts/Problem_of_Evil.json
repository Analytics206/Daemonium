    "Content": "The problem of evil is one of the most challenging questions in philosophy and theology. If an all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good God exists, why does evil exist? This dilemma has troubled thinkers for centuries. If God is omnipotent (all-powerful), He could eliminate evil. If He is omniscient (all-knowing), He would be aware of all suffering. If He is omnibenevolent (all-good), He would want to prevent suffering. And yet, the world is full of pain, cruelty, and injustice. How can this be reconciled? There are several classic responses to this problem. One is the Free Will defense, which argues that God allows evil because true free will requires the possibility of choosing wrong. If humans were incapable of evil, they wouldn’t truly be free. Another argument is the soul-making theodicy, which suggests that suffering and hardship exist to help humans grow morally and spiritually—without struggle, there would be no development of courage, compassion, or resilience. Some take a different approach and claim that human understanding is too limited to grasp divine justice. What appears to us as senseless suffering might serve a higher purpose beyond our comprehension. Others argue that evil is necessary as a contrast to good—without darkness, would we appreciate light? Atheists and skeptics, however, contend that the sheer amount of suffering in the world—natural disasters, disease, senseless violence—makes it unlikely that a benevolent God is in control. Some conclude that if a deity exists, it might not be omnipotent, omniscient, or perfectly good. The problem of evil remains a central challenge in the philosophy of religion, raising fundamental questions about morality, human suffering, and the nature of the divine. Whether one sees it as an argument against God or as a test of faith depends on one’s perspective."
