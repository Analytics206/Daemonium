    "Content": "The Trolley Problem is a thought experiment in ethics designed to challenge our moral intuitions about right and wrong. A runaway trolley is speeding down a track, and if nothing is done it will kill five people who are tied to the rails. You are standing next to a lever that can switch the trolley onto another track, where only one person is tied down. The question is simple yet deeply unsettling: do you pull the lever and actively cause one person’s death to save five, or do you do nothing and let the trolley continue on its path? On the surface, many argue that pulling the lever is the morally right choice—sacrificing one to save five follows a utilitarian approach, which prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number. But others argue that pulling the lever makes you directly responsible for the death of one person, whereas doing nothing means you did not cause harm—you merely allowed it to happen. This aligns more with deontological ethics, which emphasizes the inherent morality of actions rather than their consequences. The problem becomes even more complex with variations. Suppose instead of a lever, you could stop the trolley by pushing a large person off a bridge onto the tracks, physically using them as a human barrier. Many people instinctively reject this, even though the math is the same—one life for five. This suggests that our moral judgments are not purely logical, but shaped by deep-seated emotional and ethical principles. The Trolley Problem remains a vital ethical dilemma, especially in modern debates about self-driving cars and autonomous decision-making systems."
