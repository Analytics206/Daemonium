    "Content": "The Problem of Induction is a central challenge in epistemology, first clearly articulated by David Hume. It questions whether we can logically justify our reliance on past experiences to predict the future. Just because something has happened repeatedly in the past, does that mean it will continue to happen in the future? For example, we assume the sun will rise tomorrow because it has risen every day before—but this belief is based entirely on past experience, not absolute proof. Hume argued that inductive reasoning—drawing general conclusions from specific observations—is inherently circular. We believe the future will resemble the past because it always has, but this assumption is itself based on the very principle we are trying to justify. This problem undermines the foundation of all empirical knowledge. Science, for instance, depends heavily on induction, forming general laws from repeated experiments. If induction lacks a logical foundation, then all scientific conclusions are, in principle, uncertain. Proposed solutions include pragmatism—using induction because it works well in practice—and probabilistic reasoning—arguing that while not certain, induction is highly likely to be reliable. Yet the problem remains unresolved, showing that much of what we 'know' about the world is based not on certainty, but on habit and expectation."
