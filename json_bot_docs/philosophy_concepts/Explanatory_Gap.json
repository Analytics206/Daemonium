    "Content": "The Explanatory Gap refers to the difficulty of explaining how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective conscious experience. While neuroscience can describe mechanisms, it struggles to account for the 'what it feels like' aspect of mind, intensifying debates about physicalism and dualism."
