    "Content": "Solipsism is the philosophical idea that only one’s own mind is certain to exist. Everything else—people, objects, even the entire universe—could be an illusion existing only within your consciousness. If you have ever wondered, 'What if I’m the only real person, and everyone else is just a projection of my mind?', you’ve stumbled upon solipsism. At its core, solipsism questions whether we can ever truly know that anything beyond our subjective experience is real. After all, everything you perceive—colors, sounds, sensations—exists only within your mind as neural signals. You’ve never experienced the world directly; you only experience your mind’s interpretation of it. If this is the case, what proof is there that anything external exists at all? Philosophers like René Descartes wrestled with this dilemma. His famous statement, 'Cogito, ergo sum' ('I think, therefore I am'), was an attempt to ground certainty in at least one undeniable truth: the self that is thinking must exist. But beyond that, how do we prove the existence of anything else? Descartes ultimately invoked God as a guarantee that reality isn’t a deception. Others, like George Berkeley, argued that existence is dependent on perception—that things exist because they are perceived, whether by us or by a higher being. Solipsism is an unsettling yet fascinating idea. If taken to the extreme, it could lead to an isolated and detached way of thinking—after all, if nothing else is real, why care about anything? However, most people reject solipsism in practical life, assuming that the external world exists even if we can never prove it with absolute certainty."
