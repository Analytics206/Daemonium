    "Content": "Biological Naturalism, proposed by philosopher John Searle, holds that consciousness is both a biological phenomenon and irreducible to purely physical or computational explanations. In contrast to strict materialists—who claim that consciousness is nothing more than brain activity—and dualists—who believe mind and body are fundamentally separate—Searle argues that consciousness emerges from the brain’s biological processes but cannot be fully captured in computational or reductive physical terms.\n\nSearle rejects 'strong AI,' the view that a digital system could possess genuine understanding or subjective awareness, maintaining that computation alone does not generate consciousness. Instead, he likens consciousness to higher-order properties in nature, such as how liquidity arises from the molecular structure of water: it is fully caused by underlying physical processes yet not reducible to them.\n\nDespite its naturalistic foundation, Searle’s view acknowledges that we do not yet fully understand how neural activity produces subjective experience—the so-called 'hard problem' of consciousness. Critics argue that while Biological Naturalism emphasizes the uniqueness of biological systems, it does not clearly solve the explanatory gap between brain processes and conscious awareness.\n\nNevertheless, Biological Naturalism remains influential in contemporary debates about the mind-body relationship, artificial intelligence, and the nature of subjective experience, positioning consciousness as a natural yet fundamentally biological phenomenon."
