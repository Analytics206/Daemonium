    "Content": "The Dunning–Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability in a particular area tend to overestimate their competence, while highly skilled individuals often underestimate theirs. Identified by psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, this phenomenon occurs because those with limited knowledge or skill often lack the self-awareness needed to recognize their own shortcomings.\n\nAt its core, the effect reflects the idea that ignorance breeds overconfidence: incompetent individuals do not realize how little they know and thus assume they are more capable than they truly are. Conversely, experts tend to underestimate their abilities because they are more aware of the complexities involved and often assume that others possess similar levels of understanding.\n\nThis produces an ironic reversal—those who know the least often think they know the most, while those who are genuinely knowledgeable tend to doubt themselves. The bias has far-reaching implications in education, politics, business, and decision-making. It helps explain why unqualified individuals sometimes assume leadership roles with unwarranted confidence, why conspiracy theorists believe they hold deep insights that experts overlook, and why students may believe they understand material better than they actually do.\n\nOvercoming the Dunning–Kruger Effect requires self-awareness, humility, and continuous learning. Recognizing our own limitations is essential for avoiding poor decisions and fostering genuine intellectual growth. Ultimately, the effect serves as a reminder that true wisdom often begins with understanding how much we do not know."
