    "Content": "The Categorical Imperative is Immanuel Kant’s central principle of morality, stating that ethical actions must be universal and based on duty, not consequences. Unlike utilitarianism, which judges actions by their outcomes, Kantian ethics argues that morality is about following absolute rules that apply to everyone, regardless of circumstances. Kant expressed the Categorical Imperative in several forms, but the most famous is: 'Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.' In simpler terms: before acting, ask yourself—What if everyone did this? If the action would lead to a contradictory or undesirable world, it is morally wrong. For example, suppose you consider lying to avoid trouble. If lying were universal, trust would collapse, and communication would lose meaning. Since this creates a self-defeating world, lying is immoral. Another key formulation is: 'Treat humanity, whether in yourself or in others, always as an end, never merely as a means.' This means people must never be treated solely as tools for personal gain. Exploiting, manipulating, or devaluing others violates their dignity as rational beings. Kant’s ethics emphasize duty, respect, and moral consistency. While critics say it can be too rigid—since it rarely allows exceptions—it remains one of the most influential moral theories, challenging us to act with integrity and adopt principles that could hold for all people at all times."
