    "Content": "Terror Management Theory (TMT) is a psychological and philosophical framework that explores how humans cope with the awareness of their own mortality. Developed by Jeff Greenberg, Sheldon Solomon, and Tom Pyszczynski, the theory proposes that much of human behavior—our beliefs, values, and cultural systems—stems from a deep need to manage the existential terror of death.\n\nUnlike other animals, humans possess the unique cognitive ability to anticipate their own demise. This awareness generates profound existential anxiety, which people alleviate through what TMT calls 'symbolic immortality'—the idea that we can live on through religion, culture, accomplishments, or contributions to society. Belief systems such as religion, nationalism, and cultural traditions provide a sense of belonging, purpose, and continuity, helping individuals cope with the inevitability of death.\n\nExperimental research in TMT has demonstrated that when people are reminded of their mortality (a condition known as 'mortality salience'), they tend to become more defensive of their cultural worldviews, more likely to conform to societal norms, and more hostile toward perceived outsiders. This suggests that fear of death profoundly shapes politics, morality, intergroup relations, and even self-esteem.\n\nTMT has significant implications for understanding why people cling to ideologies, why conflicts arise between groups, and how humans construct meaning in an indifferent universe. Whether through religious faith, the pursuit of legacy, or the drive for personal achievement, Terror Management Theory suggests that much of human activity can be seen as an unconscious attempt to transcend the limits of our own mortality."
