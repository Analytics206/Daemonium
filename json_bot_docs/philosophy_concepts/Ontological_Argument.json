    "Content": "The ontological argument is a philosophical proof for God's existence based purely on logic and reason rather than empirical evidence. First formulated by Anselm of Canterbury, it begins with the definition of God as 'that than which nothing greater can be conceived.' Anselm argued that if God existed only as an idea in the mind and not in reality, then a greater being—one that exists both in thought and reality—could be imagined. Since God is defined as the greatest possible being, He must exist in reality as well as in thought, otherwise He would not truly be the greatest. The argument was later refined by René Descartes, who compared God's necessary existence to the way the concept of a triangle necessarily includes three sides. Gottfried Leibniz further strengthened the case by clarifying that God's existence must be logically possible, which would make it necessary. Critics, including Immanuel Kant, rejected the argument on the grounds that existence is not a property that can be attributed like omniscience or perfection. Kant argued that defining something into existence does not make it real. Bertrand Russell and others dismissed the argument as relying too heavily on linguistic and conceptual tricks rather than real-world evidence. Despite its controversies, the ontological argument remains one of the most debated topics in the philosophy of religion, challenging thinkers to consider whether pure logic can establish reality."
