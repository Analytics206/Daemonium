    "Content": "Moral Relativism is the philosophical view that morality is not absolute, but shaped by cultural, historical, or personal perspectives. In other words, what is considered right or wrong depends on context—there is no single universal moral truth that applies to all people at all times. This view challenges Moral Absolutism, which holds that certain ethical principles are unchanging and universally binding. For example, a moral absolutist might argue that murder is always wrong, regardless of culture or situation. A moral relativist, however, would argue that moral judgments depend on circumstances—what one society sees as immoral, another may consider acceptable or even virtuous. Types of moral relativism include: Cultural Relativism – Morality is determined by societal norms. Practices like polygamy, the death penalty, or arranged marriage may be accepted in some cultures but rejected in others. Subjective Relativism – Morality is up to each individual; what is right for one person may not be right for another. Historical Relativism – Moral values shift over time; for example, slavery was once widely accepted but is now almost universally condemned. Critics argue that moral relativism risks sliding into ethical nihilism—the belief that morality is meaningless. If no moral standard is better than another, does that mean we cannot condemn genocide or oppression? Philosophers like Immanuel Kant argue that some ethical principles must be universal to safeguard justice and human dignity. Despite its critics, moral relativism remains an important perspective in debates on tolerance, ethics, and cultural diversity. It challenges us to ask whether our moral convictions are truly objective—or simply products of our upbringing."
