    "Content": "The Gettier Problem is a philosophical challenge to the traditional definition of knowledge, showing that a person can have a justified true belief without actually possessing knowledge. Introduced by Edmund Gettier in 1963, it shook the foundations of epistemology and forced philosophers to rethink what it means to 'know' something. For centuries, knowledge was often defined as Justified True Belief (JTB)—if you believe something, have good reasons for it, and it happens to be true, then you 'know' it. Gettier challenged this by presenting cases where someone has a belief that is both justified and true, but still seems more like a coincidence than genuine knowledge. For example, suppose your friend Sarah owns a red car. One day you see her driving a red car and conclude, 'Sarah owns a red car.' Unknown to you, she sold her car the day before and was driving a rental—also red. Coincidentally, that same morning she bought another red car. Your belief was true and justified, but was it really knowledge? It feels more like a lucky accident. Gettier-style problems reveal that truth and justification alone are not enough. There must be something else—perhaps the absence of luck, stronger evidence, or a more robust method of justification. The Gettier Problem remains an open question in philosophy, inspiring new theories about what separates real knowledge from mere coincidence."
