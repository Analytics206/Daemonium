    "Content": "Dialectical materialism is the philosophical framework developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to explain how history, society, and economic structures evolve through conflict and material conditions. It combines two core principles: dialectics—the process of change driven by contradictions—and materialism—the belief that material conditions such as the economy, labor, and production shape human society more fundamentally than ideas or spiritual forces. At its core, dialectical materialism holds that history progresses through class struggle. Marx saw society as driven by contradictions between opposing economic classes: for example, feudal lords versus peasants, or capitalists versus workers. These conflicts create tensions that ultimately lead to revolutionary change. In capitalism, the central contradiction lies in the fact that wealth is produced by workers but controlled by owners. Marx predicted that this dynamic would produce inevitable struggle and eventually lead to a classless communist society. Unlike idealist philosophies, which see history as shaped primarily by ideas, dialectical materialism insists that material forces—who controls the means of production, how goods are distributed, and how labor is organized—determine the course of societal development. The dominant ideology of any era, whether religion, law, or morality, is seen as a reflection of the ruling class’s interests, not as an independent force. Dialectical materialism remains influential in political theory, economics, and sociology. While critics argue that Marx underestimated the role of human agency and cultural factors, his framework continues to shape debates on inequality, labor rights, and historical progress. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Marxist thought, dialectical materialism offers a powerful lens for analyzing power, change, and economic structures in human history."
