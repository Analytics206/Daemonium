    "Content": "Panpsychism is the philosophical view that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe and is present in some form in all things, even inanimate objects such as rocks, atoms, or entire galaxies. In contrast to materialism, which holds that consciousness arises only from complex brain activity, panpsychism suggests that mind-like qualities exist at all levels of reality, not just in humans or animals.\n\nThe idea has ancient roots in Eastern philosophy, Stoicism, and the metaphysics of Baruch Spinoza, but it has gained renewed attention in modern debates about consciousness. Traditional neuroscience struggles to explain how subjective experience emerges from purely physical processes—a mystery known as the 'hard problem of consciousness.' Panpsychism offers a radical solution by proposing that consciousness does not need to be produced at all; instead, it exists everywhere, in varying degrees.\n\nThere are several versions of panpsychism. Micropsychism proposes that fundamental particles, such as electrons, possess primitive forms of consciousness, which combine to create complex experiences like those of human beings. Cosmopsychism, on the other hand, suggests that the entire universe is itself a single, unified conscious entity.\n\nCritics argue that panpsychism is unscientific or meaningless, pointing out that it does not explain how countless small conscious entities could combine into the unified awareness of a human mind—a challenge known as the 'combination problem.' Supporters, however, see it as a promising alternative to the limitations of materialist accounts of consciousness.\n\nPanpsychism challenges the conventional divide between mind and matter, suggesting that consciousness may be as fundamental as space, time, and energy. If true, this view could radically reshape our understanding of reality, intelligence, and the very nature of life itself."
