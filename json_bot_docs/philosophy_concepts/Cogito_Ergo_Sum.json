    "Content": "Cogito, Ergo Sum (I think, therefore I am) is one of the most foundational statements in philosophy, famously stated by René Descartes. It serves as Descartes’ ultimate proof of existence and the starting point for his method of doubt. Descartes set out to find absolute certainty by questioning everything he could possibly doubt. He realized he could be deceived by his senses, misled by dreams, or even manipulated by an 'evil demon' feeding him false perceptions. If everything he perceived could be an illusion, how could he know anything for sure? One thing, however, was undeniable: the very act of doubting meant there was something doing the doubting. Even if all external reality were an illusion, the experience of thinking itself was real. Descartes concluded that, even in the most extreme skepticism, one fact remained beyond doubt—his own existence as a thinking being. The cogito is significant because it establishes a foundation for knowledge: self-awareness as the first undeniable truth. However, critics argue it assumes too much. Some question whether the 'I' in I think is justified—perhaps thoughts exist, but does that necessarily mean there is a thinker? Others challenge whether Descartes truly proves existence beyond just the mental realm. Despite these debates, Cogito, Ergo Sum remains a powerful starting point for epistemology, reminding us that no matter how uncertain the world may seem, consciousness itself is the one thing we cannot doubt."
