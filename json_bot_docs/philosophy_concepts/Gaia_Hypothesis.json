    "Content": "The Gaia Hypothesis, proposed by James Lovelock in the 1970s, posits that Earth and its biological systems function as a single, self-regulating organism that maintains conditions suitable for life. Rather than merely adapting to the environment, life actively shapes and stabilizes itâ€”regulating temperature, atmospheric composition, and ocean salinity. For instance, photosynthetic organisms maintain Earth's high oxygen levels, and biological processes help keep ocean salinity within habitable limits. While often misunderstood as suggesting Earth is alive or conscious, Lovelock described it as a model of complex feedback loops. Critics argue that evolution operates on individuals, not entire planets, and that life doesn't intentionally regulate the environment. Despite controversy, aspects of the hypothesis have been adopted in Earth system science and climate studies, influencing views on climate change, sustainability, and humanity's role in maintaining the planet's balance."
