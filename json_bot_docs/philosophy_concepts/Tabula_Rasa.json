    "Content": "Tabula Rasa—Latin for 'Blank Slate'—is the philosophical concept that individuals are born without inherent knowledge or mental content, and that all knowledge comes from experience and perception. This idea is most famously associated with John Locke, who argued that the human mind starts as a blank sheet, shaped entirely by external influences such as education, culture, and environment. The concept suggests that human behavior is not predetermined by genetics, but is shaped by upbringing and life experience. This perspective influenced modern psychology—especially behaviorism, which argues that people can be conditioned to behave in certain ways based on external stimuli. It also supports educational theories emphasizing the environment's role in shaping intelligence, character, and values. However, modern science complicates this view. Research in genetics and neuroscience suggests that some aspects of personality, intelligence, and morality may be innate. Infants show preferences, emotional responses, and problem-solving abilities before they could have learned them from experience. This evidence has led many to conclude that human nature is a mix of nature and nurture—some traits are inborn, while others are shaped by experience. Even so, Tabula Rasa remains a powerful metaphor for human potential. If we are shaped by experience, then education, culture, and personal choices hold the power to transform us. Whether or not we start as a blank slate, our ability to learn and grow is central to the human experience."
