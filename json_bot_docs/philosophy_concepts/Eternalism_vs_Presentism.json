    "Content": "The debate between eternalism and presentism concerns the nature of time and existence. Eternalism holds that all moments—past, present, and future—exist equally, much like locations in space, and is often compared to a 'block universe' where time is the fourth dimension. Just as all places exist simultaneously, all points in time exist at once, even though we experience them sequentially. This view aligns with Einstein’s theory of relativity, which suggests time is not absolute but relative to the observer. If all moments exist, concepts like fate and determinism take on greater weight, as the future is already 'out there' in some form. Presentism, by contrast, asserts that only the present moment is real—the past no longer exists and the future is yet to be determined. This view fits more closely with common-sense experience: events fade into memory, and the future remains unknown. Critics of presentism argue it struggles to account for the flow of time in a scientifically rigorous way. The debate remains unresolved, raising deep questions about free will, destiny, and whether time is something we move through or merely an illusion created by perception."
