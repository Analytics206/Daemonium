    "Content": "The Fermi Paradox addresses a profound question: if the universe is vast, ancient, and filled with billions of potentially habitable planets, why have we not seen any signs of extraterrestrial civilizations? Named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who famously asked, 'Where is everybody?' during a 1950 lunch discussion, the paradox highlights a tension between the high statistical likelihood of alien life and the absence of evidence for it. The Drake Equation estimates the number of civilizations in our galaxy, but even with conservative assumptions, the silence is puzzling. Proposed explanations range from the 'Great Filter'—a stage in the evolution of life that is extremely difficult to pass—to the idea that advanced civilizations are rare, short-lived, or deliberately avoiding contact (the 'Zoo Hypothesis'). Others suggest we may not be listening in the right way, that interstellar travel is impractical, or that intelligent life is far more uncommon than we assume. The Fermi Paradox has deep implications for science, philosophy, and humanity’s place in the cosmos, forcing us to ask whether we are alone—or whether the galaxy is teeming with life that we simply cannot detect."
