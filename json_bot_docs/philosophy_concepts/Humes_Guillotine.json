    "Content": "Hume’s Guillotine—also known as the 'is–ought problem'—is a principle introduced by David Hume which asserts that moral or prescriptive claims ('what ought to be') cannot be logically derived from purely factual or descriptive claims ('what is'). Hume observed that many arguments in ethics and philosophy jump from describing the world to prescribing how it should be without providing a rational bridge between the two. For example, the statement 'people have always engaged in warfare, therefore war is acceptable' commits this error by assuming that historical occurrence implies moral approval. Hume argued that such reasoning is invalid because facts alone do not carry inherent moral obligations; additional ethical principles or frameworks are needed. This principle has had a lasting influence on moral philosophy, challenging the notion that science, nature, or tradition alone can dictate moral truths. In contemporary debates—whether about law, politics, or social norms—Hume’s Guillotine serves as a reminder that morality requires justification beyond simply observing the way things are."
