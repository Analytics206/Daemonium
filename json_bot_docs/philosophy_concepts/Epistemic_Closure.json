    "Content": "Epistemic Closure is the principle that if someone knows a proposition (P), and knows that P entails Q, then they also know Q. Critics like Nozick argue against closure, particularly in responding to skepticism (e.g., 'I know I have hands, therefore I know I am not a brain in a vat')."
