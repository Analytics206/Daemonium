    "Content": "The 'Death of the Author,' introduced by Roland Barthes in his 1967 essay, challenges the traditional belief that an author's intentions, biography, or personal meaning determine the correct interpretation of a text. Barthes argued that once a work is created, the author’s control over its meaning ends, and interpretation lies entirely with the reader. In contrast to approaches that analyze a writer’s life or historical context to uncover the 'true' meaning, Barthes maintained that meaning is not fixed but emerges from the interaction between reader and text. This theory influenced postmodernism, deconstruction, and reader-response theory, reframing works of literature and art as independent entities open to endless interpretations. Critics argue that completely ignoring the author erases valuable historical and cultural context, and that understanding intended meaning can enrich interpretation. Despite its controversy, the 'Death of the Author' remains one of the most influential challenges to traditional literary theory, reshaping debates about meaning, authorship, and the role of the reader."
