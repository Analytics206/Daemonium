    "Content": "The No True Scotsman Fallacy is a logical error in which someone redefines a category in an ad hoc way to dismiss counterexamples that challenge their claim. Instead of reconsidering the statement, the person shifts the definition to exclude the inconvenient example. The name comes from philosopher Antony Flew’s illustration: one person claims 'No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.' When told of a Scotsman who does, they respond, 'Well, no true Scotsman does that.' The fallacy relies on circular reasoning—protecting the claim by changing terms rather than confronting evidence. This tactic often appears in ideological disputes, such as declaring, 'No real gamer plays mobile games,' or 'No true patriot criticizes their country,' and redefining the group when presented with counterexamples. The No True Scotsman Fallacy exposes how shifting goalposts can be used to avoid admitting error. Recognizing it helps identify intellectually dishonest arguments that dodge refutation by altering definitions mid-debate."
