    "Content": "The Is–Ought Problem, also known as Hume’s Guillotine, is a philosophical challenge introduced by David Hume. It questions whether moral or prescriptive statements ('ought') can be logically derived from factual or descriptive statements ('is'). Hume observed that many arguments about morality and ethics attempt to derive what should be done from observations of what is. For example, someone might argue that because humans have historically lived in hierarchical societies, we ought to continue doing so. But Hume pointed out a fundamental gap: stating a fact about the world is not the same as prescribing a moral rule. Just because something is a certain way does not mean it ought to be that way. This insight has profound implications for ethics. If moral principles cannot be logically derived from facts alone, then where do our moral obligations come from? Are they purely subjective, or do they have an independent foundation? Some philosophers argue that reason alone cannot establish moral truths, while others attempt to bridge the gap through frameworks like social contracts, human well-being, or religious doctrine. The is–ought problem forces us to examine our ethical reasoning with care. It reminds us that 'natural' or 'traditional' does not automatically mean 'right.' Many moral arguments require justification beyond mere observations about the world. This distinction remains a cornerstone of modern debates in ethics, law, and political philosophy, urging us to think critically about whether our moral conclusions are logically justified."
