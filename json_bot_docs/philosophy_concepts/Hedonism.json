    "Content": "Hedonism is the philosophical belief that pleasure is the highest good and the ultimate goal of human life. It holds that what is morally right or worthwhile is determined by what brings the most pleasure and the least pain. At its core, Hedonism rests on the simple idea that happiness is the primary measure of a good life. Ancient Greek philosophers like Epicurus championed a refined form of Hedonism, emphasizing not just fleeting physical pleasures but long-term well-being and tranquility. Epicurean Hedonism teaches that true pleasure comes from a balanced life, free from unnecessary desires, fears, and pain. This contrasts with crude or extreme Hedonism, which seeks immediate gratification without regard for consequences. Critics argue that a purely hedonistic lifestyle can be shallow or self-destructive. If pleasure is the only goal, should we avoid challenges, responsibilities, or sacrifices? Philosophers like Immanuel Kant rejected Hedonism entirely, arguing that morality should be based on duty and principles, not pleasure alone. Others, like John Stuart Mill, refined Hedonism into utilitarianism, suggesting that the best actions are those that maximize happiness for the greatest number of people, not just the individual. Hedonism remains both powerful and controversial. It raises timeless questions about what makes life meaningful and whether pleasure alone is enough for true fulfillment. While it encourages us to seek joy and avoid suffering, it also challenges us to ask: is a life devoted solely to pleasure truly a life well-lived?"
