    "Content": "David Hume’s Problem of Miracles is a skeptical argument questioning whether we can ever be justified in believing that a miracle has occurred. In his book *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*, Hume defines a miracle as a violation of natural laws—an event that contradicts our regular experience of how the world works. His argument suggests that believing in miracles requires an extraordinary level of evidence, one so strong that it would outweigh the overwhelming regularity of natural law.\n\nHume’s reasoning is grounded in probability. Natural laws are confirmed by countless consistent observations: fire burns, people do not rise from the dead, and objects fall when dropped. It is far more likely, he argues, that reports of miracles are mistaken than that natural laws have actually been broken. Faced with a choice between accepting a highly improbable event or assuming error, deception, or exaggeration, the rational conclusion is usually skepticism.\n\nHe further notes that miracle reports often originate from unreliable sources, such as religious zealots, ancient texts, or cultures without rigorous methods of verification. Human psychology, with its tendencies toward bias, wishful thinking, and sensationalism, makes miraculous claims even more suspect.\n\nThe Problem of Miracles remains central in debates within religion, epistemology, and the philosophy of science. While some argue that miracles should not be dismissed outright, Hume’s challenge urges us to critically evaluate extraordinary claims, requiring that the evidence for them be proportionate to their improbability."
