    "Content": "The Raven Paradox is a logical puzzle in the philosophy of science that challenges our understanding of how general statements are confirmed through observation. Originating from Carl Hempel’s work on confirmation theory, the paradox highlights a problem in inductive reasoning—how we justify broad scientific laws based on specific observations.\n\nHempel begins with the general statement: 'All ravens are black.' Observing a black raven appears to confirm this statement. However, by the principle of contraposition in logic, the statement is equivalent to: 'All non-black things are not ravens.' If this is true, then every time we observe a non-black object that is not a raven—such as a red apple, a blue car, or a white shirt—we also provide confirming evidence for the original statement.\n\nThis leads to the counterintuitive conclusion that seeing a green tree offers evidence that all ravens are black. While the reasoning is logically valid, it clashes with our intuition that looking at objects unrelated to ravens could meaningfully confirm a statement about ravens.\n\nSome proposed solutions suggest that not all evidence should be weighted equally, or that the concept of relevance must be incorporated into scientific confirmation. The Raven Paradox remains a central problem in confirmation theory, pushing philosophers and scientists to reconsider what truly counts as valid evidence in scientific inquiry."
