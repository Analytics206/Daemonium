        "overview": "Simone de Beauvoir was a major 20th-century French philosopher and feminist intellectual. Best known for her groundbreaking work *The Second Sex*, she helped define modern existentialism, ethics, and feminist theory. Her philosophical writings examined freedom, responsibility, oppression, and the construction of gender, offering radical critiques of patriarchy and normative roles. She was also a prolific novelist and autobiographer, blending the philosophical and the personal.",
        "historical_context": "De Beauvoir lived through both World Wars, the rise of totalitarianism, and the post-war reconfiguration of European thought. Alongside Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, she helped shape post-war French philosophy. The feminist movement of the 1960s and 70s took deep inspiration from her work, especially her critique of the social and historical construction of 'woman' as 'the Other.'",
