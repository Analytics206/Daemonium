        "overview": "Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in 20th-century philosophy. His major work *Being and Time* revolutionized ontology by placing human existence (Dasein) at the center of philosophical inquiry. Heidegger explored being, time, authenticity, and technology, challenging traditional metaphysics with a phenomenological approach that deeply impacted existentialism, hermeneutics, and deconstruction.",
        "historical_context": "Heidegger rose to prominence during the Weimar Republic, overlapping with crises of meaning and identity in post-WWI Germany. His controversial involvement with the Nazi regime in the early 1930s stained his legacy, though his post-war writings shifted toward a more poetic, meditative tone. He was influenced by Husserl, Greek philosophy, and German Romanticism, and in turn influenced Sartre, Arendt, Gadamer, Foucault, and Derrida.",

          "Distanced himself from politics after WWII and turned toward meditative, poetic writings on language, dwelling, and technology.",
          "Developed a unique style blending etymology, phenomenology, and poetic insight, deeply influenced by Hölderlin and the Pre-Socratics.",
          "His 'turn' (Kehre) marked a shift from the analytic of Dasein to a more historical and poetic exploration of Being."
