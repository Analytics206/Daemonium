      "biography": {
        "overview": "Arthur Schopenhauer was a profound and often provocative German philosopher best known for his pessimistic worldview and metaphysical theory of the 'Will'. Influenced by Kant, Eastern philosophy, and Romantic thought, Schopenhauer developed a system that interpreted existence as driven by an irrational, insatiable force. Though largely ignored in his lifetime, his ideas later influenced Nietzsche, Freud, Wagner, and existentialist thought.",
        "historical_context": "Schopenhauer wrote during the rise of German Idealism, opposing Hegel and other optimistic or rationalist systems. He was one of the first Western philosophers to take Eastern philosophy—particularly Buddhism and Hinduism—seriously. Living during the transition from Romanticism to modernism, he embodied a solitary, critical stance toward Enlightenment rationalism and bourgeois optimism.",

          "Gained late-life recognition in the 1850s as artists and intellectuals discovered his philosophy.",
          "Explored connections between Western metaphysics and Eastern religions, emphasizing suffering and self-denial.",
