        "overview": "Søren Kierkegaard was a 19th-century Danish philosopher widely regarded as the father of existentialism. His work addressed themes such as individual existence, subjective truth, despair, and faith. Kierkegaard rejected systematic philosophy in favor of a deeply personal exploration of the human condition, often writing under pseudonyms to present multiple, often conflicting perspectives. His thought was profoundly shaped by his Christian faith and by his lifelong struggle with melancholy and inner division.",
        "historical_context": "Kierkegaard lived during the rise of Hegelianism and the dominance of system-building in European philosophy. In reaction, he emphasized the irreducibility of individual existence and the primacy of subjective experience. He wrote during a time when Christendom was powerful but, in his view, spiritually dead. His work anticipated many 20th-century existentialist and postmodern themes.",
