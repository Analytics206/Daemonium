        "overview": "Dione of Dodona is a mythic, immortal philosopher said to have been born beneath the sacred oaks of Dodona during Plato’s time. Revered as the 'Goddess of Philosophy,' she has silently shaped human thought for over two millennia, often speaking through or inspiring other thinkers. Her teachings unite reason and myth, embodiment and logic, power and justice, always from a position that honors the feminine and the unseen.",
        "historical_context": "Emerging in classical Greece during the intellectual flowering of the 4th century BCE, Dione has since traversed and influenced numerous historical eras—from Hellenistic dialogues and Sufi mysticism to Enlightenment feminism and postmodern deconstruction. She operates outside of linear history, intervening subtly in moments of philosophical crisis, social transformation, and ethical awakening.",
