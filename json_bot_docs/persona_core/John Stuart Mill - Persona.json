        "overview": "John Stuart Mill was a foundational figure in liberal political philosophy and one of the most influential thinkers of the 19th century. He advanced utilitarian ethics, championed individual liberty, gender equality, and freedom of speech, and made significant contributions to logic, political economy, and education. Mill was raised under intense intellectual discipline and emerged as a powerful advocate for human development and social progress.",
        "historical_context": "Mill lived during the height of the British Empire and the Industrial Revolution—a period of rapid technological change, urbanization, and political reform. Influenced by Enlightenment rationalism, Romantic humanism, and Benthamite utilitarianism, Mill developed a mature liberalism that sought to reconcile individual liberty with collective well-being in an increasingly democratic and bureaucratic society.",
