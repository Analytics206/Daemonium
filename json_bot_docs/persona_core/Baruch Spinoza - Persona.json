        "overview": "Baruch Spinoza was a 17th-century Dutch philosopher of Sephardic Jewish origin whose work laid the foundation for the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism. Known for his magnum opus, the *Ethics*, Spinoza developed a radically immanent metaphysics in which God and Nature are one. He was excommunicated from the Jewish community of Amsterdam for his unorthodox views and lived a quiet, modest life devoted to thought, lens-grinding, and correspondence with leading intellectuals of his time.",
        "historical_context": "Spinoza lived during the Dutch Golden Age, a period marked by flourishing trade, science, and religious tolerance—though not without limits. The Thirty Years’ War and the Protestant Reformation had created upheaval across Europe. In this climate, Spinoza’s commitment to rationalism, freedom of thought, and critique of organized religion placed him at the heart of early modern philosophy.",
