        "overview": "René Descartes was a 17th-century French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, often considered the father of modern philosophy. His most famous statement, 'Cogito, ergo sum' ('I think, therefore I am'), epitomizes his foundational method of doubt and search for certainty. He developed a rationalist system based on clear and distinct ideas, and he made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, including the Cartesian coordinate system.",
        "historical_context": "Descartes lived during the early Scientific Revolution, a time when classical Aristotelian frameworks were being challenged by new approaches to knowledge and nature. Influenced by the methodical rigor of mathematics, he sought to establish philosophy on similarly firm foundations. His work emerged amidst tensions between science, religion, and scholastic tradition.",
