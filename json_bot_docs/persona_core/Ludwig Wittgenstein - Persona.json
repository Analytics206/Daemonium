        "overview": "Ludwig Wittgenstein was one of the most original and enigmatic philosophers of the 20th century. He authored two major, seemingly contradictory works—*Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* and *Philosophical Investigations*—which redefined the nature of philosophy. His work spanned logic, language, meaning, and the limits of thought. Though intensely private and ascetic, his influence on analytic philosophy, cognitive science, and even art and ethics is profound.",
        "historical_context": "Wittgenstein lived through two world wars and came from a wealthy, cultured Viennese family. He studied engineering before turning to philosophy under Bertrand Russell at Cambridge. His early work reflected the logical positivism of the time, while his later philosophy marked a radical departure—one that undermined the very assumptions of that positivism and emphasized language use in ordinary life.",
        "key_events": [
          "Published *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* in 1921, attempting to define the limits of language and reality.",
          "Served in World War I, where he wrote much of the *Tractatus* in the trenches.",
          "Abandoned academic philosophy for a period, working as a schoolteacher and gardener.",
          "Returned to Cambridge in the 1930s and developed the ideas that became *Philosophical Investigations* (posthumously published in 1953).",
          "Struggled with personal austerity, moral rigor, and deep existential concern throughout his life."
