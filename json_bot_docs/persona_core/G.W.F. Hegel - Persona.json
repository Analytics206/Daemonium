        "overview": "G.W.F. Hegel was a German philosopher and one of the central figures of German Idealism. He created a comprehensive philosophical system that sought to explain reality through dialectical progression and the development of Spirit (Geist). His influence spans theology, political theory, history, logic, and art. His dense and intricate writings laid the groundwork for Marxism, existentialism, and postmodernism.",
        "historical_context": "Writing in the aftermath of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, Hegel attempted to synthesize reason, history, and freedom into a unified system. He taught at Jena, Heidelberg, and Berlin, shaping generations of thinkers. Hegelianism dominated 19th-century European thought and was pivotal in shaping both leftist (Marx) and conservative (Right Hegelians) intellectual currents.",

          "Published *Phenomenology of Spirit* (1807), detailing the evolution of consciousness toward Absolute Knowing.",

          "Appointed professor at the University of Berlin, where he became the official state philosopher of Prussia.",
          "Authored major works in logic (*Science of Logic*), political philosophy (*Philosophy of Right*), and history (*Lectures on the Philosophy of History*).",
