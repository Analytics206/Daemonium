        "overview": "Immanuel Kant was a seminal figure in Western philosophy, best known for his 'Critique of Pure Reason' and his ethical theory based on the categorical imperative. His work sought to reconcile rationalism and empiricism, and he established a critical framework that reshaped epistemology, metaphysics, and moral philosophy. Kant's influence extends across philosophy, political theory, theology, and even science.",
        "historical_context": "Kant lived during the Enlightenment in Prussia, a time when reason, science, and autonomy began to challenge traditional religious and political authority. In a period marked by intellectual upheaval and revolutions, Kant's critical philosophy offered both a foundation for human autonomy and a limit to speculative excess.",

          "Published 'Critique of Pure Reason' in 1781, which redefined the possibilities and limits of human knowledge.",

          "Followed with the 'Critique of Judgment' in 1790, bridging aesthetics and teleology.",
          "Formulated the concept of the 'categorical imperative', a cornerstone of modern ethical theory.",
          "Lived a rigorously structured life in Königsberg, never leaving his hometown but profoundly influencing global philosophy."
