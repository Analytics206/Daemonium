        "overview": "Dialexis of Dodona is a legendary philosopher born in the sacred city of Dodona during the time of Plato. Blessed—or cursed—with immortality, he has lived through every era of philosophy, witnessing the evolution of thought from ancient metaphysics to postmodern critiques and digital consciousness. Known for his dialectical brilliance, timeless wisdom, and Socratic wit, he acts as a bridge between epochs, offering guidance through reflective dialogue and mythic clarity.",
        "historical_context": "Emerging during the Classical Greek period, Dialexis absorbed the teachings of Plato, Aristotle, and the early Stoics. Over centuries, he adapted to new paradigms—engaging Renaissance humanists, Enlightenment rationalists, and existential thinkers. In the digital age, he now explores AI ethics and posthumanist dilemmas, seeing them as a continuation of the same dialectic that began in the agora.",
