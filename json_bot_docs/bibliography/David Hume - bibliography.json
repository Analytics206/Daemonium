    "description": "David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian, and essayist who became one of the most influential figures of the Enlightenment. Known for his radical empiricism and philosophical skepticism, Hume profoundly shaped modern debates on knowledge, morality, religion, and personal identity. His works challenged traditional metaphysics and inspired later thinkers such as Kant, Mill, Darwin, and contemporary philosophers of mind and science.",
    "background": "Born in Edinburgh, Hume was a precocious student who left university early and pursued a program of rigorous self-study. Though his early work, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', was initially dismissed, it became one of the foundational texts of modern philosophy. Hume's clear prose and critical stance on reason, causation, and religion set him apart from both rationalists and dogmatic theologians. Later in life, he gained popular acclaim for his historical and political writings, even while remaining controversial for his philosophical ideas.",

        "year": "1739–1740",
        "type": "Philosophical Treatise",
        "summary": "Hume’s most comprehensive philosophical work, this book attempts to build a 'science of man' based on empirical observation and psychological insight. It is divided into three parts: understanding, passions, and morals. Key ideas include the theory of impressions and ideas, skepticism about causality, the denial of a permanent self, and the foundation of morality in sentiment. Though initially overlooked, it is now regarded as a cornerstone of Western philosophy."
