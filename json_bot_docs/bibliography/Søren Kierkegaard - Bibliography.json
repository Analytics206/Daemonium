      "description": "Søren Kierkegaard was a Danish philosopher, theologian, poet, and cultural critic, often considered the father of existentialism. Writing under various pseudonyms, he explored themes such as anxiety, despair, faith, individuality, and the leap into belief. His works confront the existential condition of man and the tension between the aesthetic, ethical, and religious stages of life.",
      "background": "Born in Copenhagen into a deeply religious and melancholic household, Kierkegaard was marked by his father's intense spirituality and guilt. He studied theology but never entered the clergy. Instead, he used literature and philosophy to grapple with Christian existence and subjective truth. His relationship with Regine Olsen—whom he loved but broke off engagement with—shaped much of his thought on love, sacrifice, and despair.",

The aesthetic is characterized by pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of commitment, while the ethical embraces responsibility and moral seriousness. The book sets up the existential tension between living for immediate enjoyment and striving for authenticity."

      "influence": "Kierkegaard laid the groundwork for existentialism, influencing 20th-century thinkers like Heidegger, Sartre, and Camus. His theological insights shaped modern Christian thought, notably Karl Barth, Paul Tillich, and Reinhold Niebuhr. He also impacted literature and psychology, including figures like Franz Kafka and Rollo May.",
      "note": "Kierkegaard’s use of pseudonyms was intended to present various existential viewpoints rather than his own, encouraging readers to grapple with truth personally. His work was largely unrecognized during his lifetime but gained prominence in the 20th century."
