      "description": "Arthur Schopenhauer was a German philosopher best known for his pessimistic philosophy and metaphysical analysis of the will. His work profoundly influenced existentialism, psychoanalysis, literature, and modern philosophy, especially through his central concept of the 'will to live' as the irrational force behind all existence.",
      "background": "Born in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), Schopenhauer was educated in classical literature, science, and philosophy. Deeply influenced by Kant, the Upanishads, and Buddhism, he developed a unique system centered around the idea that blind, insatiable will is the essence of reality. Though largely unrecognized in his lifetime, he later became one of the most influential thinkers of the 19th and 20th centuries.",
