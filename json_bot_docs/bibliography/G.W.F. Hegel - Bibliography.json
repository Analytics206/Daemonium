      "description": "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German philosopher and a central figure in German idealism. His work laid the foundation for much of modern philosophy, particularly in the areas of logic, metaphysics, history, and political theory. Hegel is best known for his dialectical method, his comprehensive philosophical system, and his influential views on history, freedom, and the development of human consciousness.",
      "background": "Born in Stuttgart, Hegel studied theology before turning to philosophy. Deeply influenced by Kant, he sought to overcome the dualisms of Enlightenment rationalism and Kantian thought. His dialectical method—based on the dynamic development of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis—allowed him to present history, consciousness, and reality as rational and self-unfolding. Hegel held academic posts in Jena, Heidelberg, and Berlin, becoming one of the most influential philosophers in European history.",
