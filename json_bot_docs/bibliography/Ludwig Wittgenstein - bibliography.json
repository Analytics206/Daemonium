      "description": "Ludwig Wittgenstein was an Austrian-British philosopher whose work fundamentally shaped 20th-century philosophy, especially in logic, language, mind, and epistemology. His thought is marked by two distinct phases—early and later—which produced two of the most influential philosophical works of the modern era.",
      "background": "Wittgenstein was born in Vienna into a wealthy and intellectual family. He studied engineering before turning to philosophy under Bertrand Russell at Cambridge. He led a reclusive and deeply introspective life, often retreating from academia to rethink the foundations of his philosophy. His career is defined by the contrast between the logical atomism of his early work and the ordinary language philosophy of his later work.",

      "chronological_periods": {
        "early_period": {
          "characteristics": "Focused on the logical structure of language and reality, influenced by Frege and Russell. Advocated a picture theory of language and the limits of what can be said.",
          "themes": "Logic, representation, the world-language relation, silence, atomism"
        },
        "middle_period": {
          "characteristics": "A period of doubt and reformulation, where Wittgenstein reconsidered his earlier views and began developing new approaches to language and meaning.",
          "themes": "Doubt about logical form, rule-following, ordinary language, language in use"
        },
        "late_period": {
          "characteristics": "Focused on language as a social activity, emphasizing context, 'language games,' and the idea that meaning is use. Abandoned formalism for philosophical therapy.",
          "themes": "Language games, rule-following, family resemblance, forms of life, anti-foundationalism"

      "influence": "Wittgenstein profoundly influenced analytic philosophy, particularly philosophy of language, mind, and epistemology. His ideas shaped ordinary language philosophy and inspired figures like Elizabeth Anscombe, P.F. Strawson, Saul Kripke, and contemporary thinkers exploring language, normativity, and cognitive science.",
      "note": "Wittgenstein published only one book in his lifetime, yet his notebooks and lectures posthumously reshaped the philosophical landscape. His legacy is one of radical transformation—he essentially changed his own philosophical foundations mid-life and redefined what philosophy itself could be."
