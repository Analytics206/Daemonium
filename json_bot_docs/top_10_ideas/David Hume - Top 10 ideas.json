        "idea": "Empiricism",
        "description": "Hume asserted that all human knowledge arises from sensory experience. He argued that the mind is a blank slate at birth and that all ideas originate from impressions—vivid sensory experiences. Complex ideas are merely combinations or associations of simpler impressions. This radical empiricism challenged the rationalist notion that certain knowledge could be attained purely through reason.",

        "description": "Hume famously questioned the rational basis of inductive reasoning. He argued that we have no logical justification for believing that the future will resemble the past, even though we rely on this assumption for science and daily life. The uniformity of nature cannot be proven by experience, because that would be circular reasoning. This insight sparked a fundamental issue in epistemology and the philosophy of science.",

He claimed that when we introspect, we do not observe a 'self' but rather a bundle of fleeting perceptions—sensations, thoughts, emotions—in constant flux. This 'bundle theory' radically undermined the traditional metaphysical view of personal identity.",

Our approval or disapproval of actions stems from feelings of pleasure or pain associated with them. Moral judgments express human emotions rather than objective facts. This contrasted sharply with rationalist ethics, and presaged modern emotivism and moral psychology.",

We never perceive causation directly; we simply observe constant conjunction and develop an expectation. This deeply influenced later thinkers like Kant, who attempted to respond to Hume’s challenge.",

Since natural law is established by consistent experience, he deemed miracle reports inherently unreliable. This was a powerful critique of religious claims.",
