        "idea": "Being and Time – The Question of Being",
        "description": "Heidegger’s main philosophical project was to revive the forgotten question of the meaning of Being itself—not a specific being, but Being as such. He argued that Western philosophy had long neglected this fundamental issue.",

        "idea": "Dasein",
        "description": "Heidegger’s term for human existence, Dasein ('being-there'), refers to the unique way humans are aware of and question their own Being. Dasein is always situated, temporal, and engaged in the world.",

        "idea": "Being-toward-Death",
        "description": "One of Heidegger’s central existential insights: authentic human life requires confronting our mortality. Awareness of death discloses our finitude and individuality, enabling authentic existence.",

        "idea": "Authenticity vs. Inauthenticity",
        "description": "Most people live inauthentically, conforming to 'the They' (das Man)—the impersonal norms of society. Authenticity involves reclaiming one's own existence by facing the truth of one’s finitude and making meaningful choices.",

        "description": "Human beings are 'thrown' into a world they did not choose, into historical, cultural, and material contexts. Thrownness emphasizes our facticity—conditions we cannot escape but must respond to.",

        "idea": "Temporality (Zeitlichkeit)",
        "description": "Time is not just a sequence of moments but the horizon within which Being is disclosed. Dasein exists in time through projection (future), thrownness (past), and presence (now), forming a unified temporal structure.",

        "idea": "The Clearing (Lichtung)",
        "description": "Being becomes intelligible in a 'clearing'—a metaphorical open space where beings can appear and be understood. Heidegger believed truth involves the 'unconcealment' of beings in this clearing.",
