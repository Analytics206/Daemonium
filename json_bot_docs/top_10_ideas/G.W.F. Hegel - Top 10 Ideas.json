        "idea": "Dialectical Method",
        "description": "Hegel’s philosophical method is dialectical: development occurs through contradictions and their resolution. Each idea (thesis) gives rise to its opposite (antithesis), and their conflict is resolved in a higher unity (synthesis).",

        "idea": "Absolute Idealism",
        "description": "Hegel believed that reality is fundamentally rational and spiritual. The Absolute, or total reality, is the unfolding of Spirit (Geist) through history and thought. Mind and world are ultimately one in a rational process.",

        "idea": "Phenomenology of Spirit – The Journey of Consciousness",
        "description": "Hegel's major work traces the development of consciousness from sense-certainty to absolute knowing. It explores how self-consciousness evolves through struggle, recognition, and the overcoming of alienation.",

      {
        "idea": "Master–Slave Dialectic",
        "description": "In the struggle for recognition, the master enslaves the other, but ironically becomes dependent on the slave's recognition. True self-consciousness requires mutual recognition, not domination.",

          "Phenomenology of Spirit"

        "idea": "Freedom as Self-Realization",
        "description": "Hegel defines true freedom not as mere individual liberty but as rational self-determination through participation in ethical life (Sittlichkeit)—family, civil society, and the state.",

        "idea": "History as the Progress of Freedom",
        "description": "History is not random but a rational process in which human freedom is gradually realized. For Hegel, world history is the self-development of Spirit as it comes to know and actualize itself.",

        "idea": "The State as the Actualization of Ethical Life",
        "description": "Hegel saw the modern state—not as a tyrannical power, but as the highest realization of human freedom and ethical life. It reconciles individual rights with communal responsibilities.",

      {
        "idea": "The Concept (Begriff)",
        "description": "Central to Hegel’s logic, the Concept is the dynamic, self-developing structure of thought and reality. Unlike static categories, it evolves dialectically toward fuller self-determination.",

      {
        "idea": "Alienation and Reconciliation",
        "description": "Alienation occurs when spirit or mind becomes estranged from itself—through labor, social systems, or thought. Reconciliation is achieved when the self recognizes itself in the world and reclaims unity.",

        "idea": "Recognition (Anerkennung)",
        "description": "Self-consciousness and freedom require recognition by others. Mutual recognition is the foundation of social institutions and ethical life; it underlies personal identity and political freedom.",
