      {
        "idea": "Picture Theory of Language",
        "description": "Early Wittgenstein proposed that language functions by representing facts about the world through logical structures, or 'pictures.' A proposition is meaningful if it mirrors a possible state of affairs.",
        "key_books": [
          "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Limits of Language = Limits of World",
        "description": "In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein argues that what can be said clearly can be said at all; everything else must be passed over in silence. Language defines the boundaries of what is thinkable and sayable.",

          "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Language Games",
        "description": "Later Wittgenstein introduced the idea of language as a collection of diverse 'language games' embedded in specific forms of life. Meaning is determined by use, not abstract correspondence to reality.",
        "key_books": [
          "Philosophical Investigations"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Meaning Is Use",
        "description": "Words derive their meaning from how they are used in practical contexts rather than from intrinsic definitions or reference to objects. This principle underpins Wittgenstein’s later philosophy.",
        "key_books": [
          "Philosophical Investigations"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Private Language Argument",
        "description": "Wittgenstein argued that a truly private language, understandable by only a single individual and referring to purely internal states, is incoherent because language is necessarily a public, rule-governed activity.",
        "key_books": [
          "Philosophical Investigations"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Rule-Following Paradox",
        "description": "Wittgenstein questioned how following a rule is possible if no future application of it is logically entailed by a finite series of examples. Rule-following depends on communal practices and agreement.",
        "key_books": [
          "Philosophical Investigations"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Form of Life",
        "description": "Understanding a language requires familiarity with the social and cultural practices—'forms of life'—within which language has meaning. This concept ties language to shared human activities.",
        "key_books": [
          "Philosophical Investigations"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Family Resemblance Concepts",
        "description": "Many concepts (like 'game') lack a single essence but are united by overlapping similarities, or family resemblances. This challenges the traditional search for rigid definitions in philosophy.",
        "key_books": [
          "Philosophical Investigations"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Anti-Theoretical Philosophy",
        "description": "Wittgenstein rejected grand philosophical theories in favor of therapeutic methods that clarify how language is misused in philosophical confusion. Philosophy should resolve confusion, not construct doctrines.",

          "Philosophical Investigations",
          "The Blue and Brown Books"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Philosophy as Therapy",
        "description": "Wittgenstein conceived philosophy as a kind of therapy that dissolves confusions arising from misuses of language. Philosophical problems are illusions rooted in linguistic misunderstanding.",

      {
        "idea": "The Sayable and the Unsayable",
        "description": "In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein distinguished between what can be said (facts and logical propositions) and what can only be shown (ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics), asserting that the most important things lie beyond language.",
