      {
        "idea": "The Second Sex – Woman as 'Other'",
        "description": "In patriarchal society, woman is not defined as a subject in her own right but as 'the Other' in relation to man. This foundational idea critiques the structural othering of women and calls for existential liberation.",

        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Existential Feminism",
        "description": "De Beauvoir combined existentialist ethics with feminist analysis, asserting that women must create their own essence through free action and transcend the roles imposed upon them by culture and history.",
        "key_books": [
          "The Second Sex",
          "The Ethics of Ambiguity"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "One Is Not Born, but Rather Becomes, a Woman",
        "description": "Gender is not innate but socially constructed. This revolutionary idea challenged essentialist views of womanhood and became foundational for feminist theory, especially gender performativity.",
        "key_books": [
          "The Second Sex"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Freedom and Ambiguity",
        "description": "Human freedom exists in tension with ambiguity. We are free, but our choices are constrained by our facticity (social, historical, physical conditions). Ethics must navigate this tension.",
        "key_books": [
          "The Ethics of Ambiguity"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Immanence vs. Transcendence",
        "description": "Women have been relegated to 'immanence'—the passive, interior, and repetitive—while men claim 'transcendence'—activity, progress, and external creation. Liberation requires women reclaim transcendence.",
        "key_books": [
          "The Second Sex"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Reciprocal Recognition",
        "description": "Building on Hegel and Sartre, de Beauvoir emphasized that authentic human relations require reciprocal recognition of freedom. Domination—especially gendered domination—destroys this reciprocity.",

          "The Ethics of Ambiguity"
        ]

      {
        "idea": "Ethics of Liberation and Responsibility",
        "description": "De Beauvoir argued that genuine ethics must be rooted in freedom, responsibility, and the active promotion of others’ freedom. Oppression is unethical because it denies others their subjectivity.",
        "key_books": [
          "The Ethics of Ambiguity"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Old Age as a Social and Existential Problem",
        "description": "She explored how aging strips individuals of subjectivity in the eyes of society, mirroring how women are objectified. She examined the marginalization and invisibility of the elderly.",
        "key_books": [
          "The Coming of Age"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Myth of the Eternal Feminine",
        "description": "The idea that there is an essential 'feminine nature' is a myth constructed by patriarchal culture. This myth freezes women into predefined roles, denying them historical and existential freedom.",

          "The Second Sex"
        ]
      },
      {
        "idea": "Intersection of Existentialism and Social Structures",
        "description": "Though existentialism emphasizes personal freedom, de Beauvoir insisted on the material and social limits imposed on individuals—particularly women—and challenged pure voluntarism in favor of historical consciousness.",
        "key_books": [
          "The Second Sex",

      {
        "idea": "Literature as Philosophical Expression",
        "description": "De Beauvoir saw literature as a powerful means to explore ethical and existential dilemmas. Through fiction and memoir, she enacted the complexity of moral freedom and responsibility.",
