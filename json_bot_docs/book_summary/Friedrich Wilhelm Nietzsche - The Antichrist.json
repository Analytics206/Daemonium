The Antichrist is not a devil, but a thinker who unmasks the highest lies. Christianity—the greatest lie. Not error, not illusion, but willful reversal of all natural values. I write for the strong, not the meek—for those ready to transvalue all values, to sweep away the dust of millennia."

It is a religion of decadence—born from resentment, spread by deceit. It poisons the strong with pity, turns the proud into sinners, and teaches man to despise the very instincts that make him noble. It is not moral; it is mortal—it infects vitality like a slow disease, clothed in virtue."

Christianity turns pity into a virtue—and thereby makes weakness contagious. We must unlearn pity, not because we are cruel, but because we are honest. Let the diseased perish: that is nature’s way. And let us not weep for it."

And in place of a free, vital, noble man, it offers the slave: obedient, humble, terrified of his own instincts. This is the moral revolution of the weak, who, unable to rise above, turn downward and call it elevation. They make 'heaven' a reward for submission and 'hell' a punishment for passion. This inversion is the true Fall of Man."

It was Paul who resurrected the lie—turning a rebel mystic into the crucified God, birthing the Church on the grave of truth."

It has persecuted philosophers, mutilated science, and crushed joy. It preaches celibacy and poverty while hoarding power and gold. Its saints are freaks, its martyrs are liars, and its heaven is a bribe. The Church has stood against every noble instinct man has had—and it has called that victory 'God’s will.'"

To sell salvation, one must first create the disease. I say: there is no sin—only life denied."

It deifies suffering, demands sacrifice, and calls the end of instincts 'spirituality.' But behind this will is hatred—hatred of life, of reality, of strength. The Christian wants the world to end, so he can be proven right."

In this war, Jerusalem triumphed—but what was gained? A thousand years of darkness and decline."
