        "title": "Critique of Religion and Morality",
        "content": "Nietzsche is arguably most famous for his criticisms of traditional European moral commitments, together with their foundations in Christianity. This critique is very wide-ranging; it aims to undermine not just religious faith or philosophical moral theory, but also many central aspects of ordinary moral consciousness, some of which are difficult to imagine doing without (e.g., altruistic concern, guilt for wrongdoing, moral responsibility, the value of compassion, the demand for equal consideration of persons, and so on).",
        "key_concepts": {
          "god_is_dead": "The famous, aggressive and paradoxical pronouncement that 'God is dead' - not so much that atheism is true, but that because 'the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable', everything that was 'built upon this faith, propped up by it, grown into it', including 'the whole of our European morality', is destined for 'collapse'.",
          "slave_revolt_in_morality": "Nietzsche's explanation for how we got from good/bad valuation to good/evil thinking. People who suffered from oppression developed a persistent, corrosive emotional pattern of resentful hatred (ressentiment) against their enemies, which motivated the development of the new moral concept 'evil'.",
          "good_bad_vs_good_evil": {
            "good_bad_pattern": "The idea of goodness originated in social class privilege: the good were first understood to be those of the higher social order, then eventually transferred to traits of character and personal excellences associated with the privileged caste. Goodness is associated with exclusive virtues - there is no thought that everyone should be excellent.",
            "good_evil_pattern": "Focuses its negative evaluation (evil) on violations of the interests or well-being of others—and consequently its positive evaluation (good) on altruistic concern for their welfare. Has universalistic pretensions: if it is to promote and protect the welfare of all, its restrictions and injunctions must apply to everyone equally."
          },
          "guilt_and_bad_conscience": "Guilt bears a close conceptual connection to the notion of debt. The moralized notion of guilt developed through a transfer of this structure from the domain of material debt to a wider class of actions that violate some socially accepted norm. The condemnation attaches a negative assessment to the guilty person's basic sense of personal worth.",
          "ascetic_ideal": "The idealization of asceticism extends the valorization of self-discipline into a thoroughgoing form of self-condemnation, in which self-discipline is turned against the agent herself and comes to express the person's commitment to her own fundamental worthlessness."
        }
      },
      "3_value_creation": {
        "title": "Value Creation",
        "content": "Neither Nietzsche's ideas about the nature of value creation nor his suggestions about what specific values should be 'created' have seemed as clear to readers as his negative critique of traditional values. Nietzsche's talk about the creation of values challenges philosophical common sense by treating value as 'created' rather than discovered in the world.",

            "title": "Nietzsche's Meta-ethical Stance and the Nature of Value Creation",
            "content": "Nietzsche challenges the basic philosophical conception when he treats value as 'created' rather than discovered in the world: 'We [contemplatives] … are those who really continually fashion something that had not been there before: the whole eternally growing world of valuations, colors, accents, perspectives, scales, affirmations, and negations. … Whatever has value in our world now does not have value in itself, according to its nature—nature is always value-less—but has been given value at some time, as a present—and it was we who gave and bestowed it.'",

            "title": "Some Nietzschean Values",
            "content": "Nietzsche praises many different values, and in the main, he does not follow the stereotypically philosophical strategy of deriving his evaluative judgments from one or a few foundational principles. While the resulting axiological landscape is complex, we can get a sense of its shape by considering six values that play indisputably important roles.",

                "title": "Power and Life",
                "content": "The closest Nietzsche comes to organizing his value claims systematically is his insistence on the importance of power, especially if this is taken together with related ideas about strength, health, and 'life'.",
                "key_quote": "What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself. What is bad? Everything that is born of weakness. What is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome.",
                "interpretations": [
                  "Power as overcoming resistance - connects power directly to the person's capacity to reshape her environment in the service of her ends",
                  "Power as growth, strength, domination, or expansion - a 'thicker', more substantive ethical idea",

                "content": "A second value commitment prominent in Nietzsche's work is the value of affirmation. According to Reginster, 'Nietzsche regards the affirmation of life as his defining philosophical achievement'.",

                "key_quote": "I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: someday I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.",
                "purpose": "The affirmation of life can be framed as the rejection of nihilism. It should both undermine values by reference to which the world could not honestly be affirmed, while also articulating the values exemplified by life and the world that make them affirmable."

                "content": "If we are to affirm our life and the world, we had better be honest about what they are really like. Arguably, no other virtue gets more, or more unqualified, praise in the Nietzschean corpus: honesty is 'our virtue, the last one left to us', and truthfulness is the measure of strength, or even of value as such.",
                "key_quote": "How much truth does a spirit endure, how much truth does it dare? More and more that became for me the real measure of value.",

                "title": "Art and Artistry",
                "content": "If truthfulness is a core value for Nietzsche, he is nevertheless famous for insisting that we also need illusion to live well. From the beginning of his career to the end, he insisted on the irreplaceable value of art precisely because of its power to ensconce us in illusion.",
                "key_quote": "We possess art lest we perish of the truth.",
                "two_levels": {
                  "higher_order": "We should learn from artists 'how to make things beautiful, attractive, desirable for ourselves when they are not'. Artistic methods provide a formal model for the development of analogous techniques that could be deployed beyond art, in life itself.",
                  "first_order": "What makes a life admirable includes its aesthetic features. To 'attain satisfaction with himself' one should 'give style' to one's character."

                "tension_with_truthfulness": "The value of art and artistry often seem to stand in opposition to the value of truthfulness—we are supposed to need art to save us from the truth. Art serves as a 'counterforce' against our honesty by showing that there can be something valuable about remaining content with appearances."

                "title": "Individuality, Autonomy, 'Freedom of Spirit'",
                "content": "From the earliest reception, commentators have noted the value Nietzsche places on individuality and on the independence of the 'free spirit' from confining conventions of society, religion, or morality. However, he resists any thought that every single human person has value on the strength of individuality alone.",
                "key_quote": "Self-interest is worth as much as the person who has it: it can be worth a great deal, and it can be unworthy and contemptible.",
                "approaches": [
                  "Natural characteristics - valuable individuals must have certain given, natural characteristics that make them 'higher men'",
                  "Ideal or norm - the 'true' or 'higher self' is a kind of ideal to which a person may, or may not, live up",
                  "Freedom from fanaticism - what opposes Nietzschean freedom of spirit is fanaticism, understood as vehement commitment to some faith given from without",

                "title": "Pluralism",
                "content": "Nietzsche's values appear to remain irreducible to a single common value or principle that explains them all. That very fact fits nicely with another of Nietzsche's core values, the value of pluralism itself.",
                "key_quote": "There is only a perspectival seeing, only a perspectival 'knowing'; and the more affects we allow to speak about a matter, the more eyes, different eyes, we know how to bring to bear on one and the same matter, that much more complete will our 'concept' of this matter, our 'objectivity', be.",
                "significance": "For a person's ability to deploy and be responsive to a multiplicity of values, of virtues, of outlooks and 'perspectives', is a positive good in its own right. The ability to deploy a variety of perspectives is just as important for our practical and evaluative lives as it is for cognitive life."

        "title": "The Self and Self-fashioning",
        "content": "A probing investigation into the psyche was a leading preoccupation for Nietzsche throughout his career. Nietzsche's psychology is central to his evaluative agenda and to his projects as a cultural critic.",
        "key_concepts": {
          "psychology_as_queen": "Psychology should be recognized again as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and preparation the other sciences exist. For psychology is once again on the path to the fundamental problems.",
          "skepticism_about_self": "A significant body of Nietzschean texts express extreme skepticism that there is any such thing as a 'self', or 'soul', as well as doubts about the traditional faculties of the soul and the basic capacities they were supposed to exercise.",
          "reformed_conception": "Nietzsche's own proposal was to develop a radically reformed conception of the psyche, rather than to reject the self, or soul, altogether. The soul as he understands it will be internally complex, rather than simple, and therefore subject to disintegration.",
          "soul_as_social_structure": "The soul should be understood as 'mortal soul', 'soul as subjective multiplicity', and 'soul as social structure of the drives and affects'. The drives and affects are supposed to serve as the constituents comprising this multiplicity.",
          "drives_and_affects": "Drives are dispositions toward general patterns of activity; they aim at activity of the relevant sort and represent some specific object or occasion of the activity. Affects are emotional states that combine a receptive and felt responsiveness to the world with a tendency toward a distinctive pattern of reaction.",
          "self_as_achieved": "Nietzsche's psychology treats the self as something that has to be achieved or constructed, rather than as something fundamentally given as part of the basic metaphysical equipment with which a person enters the world."

        "self_fashioning": {
          "content": "The project of individual self-fashioning, or self-creation, is located at the heart of Nietzsche's philosophical agenda. The main goal would be to construct novel, interesting, and culturally resonant individual lives, whose overall shape they could affirm on the strength of the aesthetic value they instantiate.",

        "title": "Difficulties of Nietzsche's Philosophical Writing",
        "content": "Perhaps nothing about Nietzsche's work seems more out of step with the ordinary procedures of philosophy than the way he writes. Most philosophers write treatises or scholarly articles, governed by a carefully articulated thesis for which they present a sustained argument. Nietzsche's books are nothing like that.",
        "characteristics": {
          "aphoristic_style": "Many books are divided into short, numbered sections, which only sometimes have obvious connections to nearby sections. Nietzsche approaches 'deep problems like cold baths: quickly into them and quickly out again'.",

          "literary_techniques": "Nietzsche's writing is full of figures of speech and literary tropes. He makes heavy use of allusions to both contemporary and historical writing, and invents personas to work out views he will go on to qualify or reject.",
          "rhetorical_intensity": "The heat and vitriol with which his condemnations of traditional values are presented. The work is deliberately designed to be as offensive as possible to earnest believers, perhaps operating as a strategy for audience partition."
