0:00
we're here today to talk about love it's one of those things that's central
0:06
to human life that we value very highly but that is notoriously difficult to define
0:14
and it makes love a questionable topic for philosophy these days
0:19
wittgenstein uh he once wrote whatever can be said can be said clearly
0:25
and that of which we cannot speak one must remain silent sort of like the uh
0:30
summation of the trochtatus wittgenstein in that sentence sort of offers us the epitome
0:37
of how it is that the modern mind has come to regard many of our formerly most
0:44
cherished values things like love as impossible to analyze or
0:51
things that we can't actually make clear statements about because we can't find them and therefore they're not worthy or they
0:59
don't merit deep philosophical consideration i'm not knocking wickenstein here
1:06
he clearly had a reverence for the mystical side of life we'll say um in
1:12
his personal beliefs and i'm not even trying to make any claims about his broader philosophy i just like the quotation because i think it
1:19
sums up how a lot of modern people think about things you know we became ever more skeptical
1:28
of vague and ill-defined or undefinable terms such as truth or beauty or love that
1:34
doesn't mean we stopped appreciating beauty or seeking the truth or loving
1:40
but a funny thing i think has happened to the modern mind and that we now feel that we don't have
1:46
to think about these things anymore it's the irony of relativism is that it doesn't
1:52
open our minds up to infinite possibilities
1:57
on the contrary it makes everything subjective and thus impossible to debate
2:03
and so why would philosophy have caused to explore flighty
2:09
cloudy ideas such as love there's no coherent definition to be found isn't
2:15
love upon closer examination just a chemical reaction in your brain anyway um you know why not leave topics like
2:23
love for poetry and direct our philosophical concerns towards a more rigorous matters
2:30
um and so you know even if i'm not i'm not really trying to talk about any philosophers or any school of
2:36
philosophers again i'd emphasize i'm just speaking of modern people generally that we tend to be dismissive
2:42
of the mysteries of existence and we tend to be reductive materialist when it comes to things like love
2:48
um science has more or less explained everything physiological or biological
2:54
um and our subjective experiences in some sense not
2:59
you know that you're never going to get to any kind of objective fact there
3:04
and in terms of the scientific method one's subjective experience is not proof of anything
3:10
and so in the most rigorous terms your subjective experience can't tell us much about reality right um
3:17
and so most of us have the experience of love but we also have the experience of all sorts of
3:22
other physiological states such as hunger or adrenaline or fatigue
3:28
um and so we can attribute why do we attribute so much special
3:35
attention to love well there's an answer for that within the sciences too right because we have this human preoccupation with love
3:42
since time immemorial due to the central importance of like the sexual reproduction of the species
3:48
the fact that humans typically reproduce in monogamous family units they exist as these extended kin groups which makes us
3:55
social beings and then that makes us beings who continue our existence through bonds of love
4:02
among other things i mean there's bonds of duty and obligation but there's also bones of love
4:07
and so you could say if you were going to be cynical well of course this makes love
4:12
seem like the most important thing in the world to human beings and it makes sense from a scientific standpoint that
4:18
we should feel that way but nevertheless it's just a chemical reaction really nothing to see here
Modern Prejudices
4:26
i'm not going to quarrel with any of these modern ideas or i'm not going to mount a counter argument at this point
4:34
i simply think we should start out by recognizing what the modern prejudices are
4:39
and um because to do that is to be able to stand apart from them
4:44
by that same act right and so this recognition of what may
4:49
be perhaps our own views on love whether it's the view i outlined or some other view that you hold
4:56
just being aware that will allow us to at least try to engage with the text of plato's
5:02
symposium the way that the ancients did because to the men discoursing
5:08
in plato's symposium there is no advanced science of evolutionary biology or human
5:15
physiology there's no naturalistic explanations of mankind as
5:20
simply one species among other species they did not feel that they had
5:26
definitive or final explanations for the phenomenon of love
5:33
perhaps they didn't feel they had final explanation for any phenomenon and so in the world
5:38
of plato's symposium the world that we're stepping into the ancient greek world
5:43
there was actually ironically enough probably more epistemic humility than we have now not less and a lot of this is
5:51
my opinion but i think when we knew a whole lot less and were aware that we
5:57
knew a whole lot less we were less arrogant i think there's a modern caricature of like the primitive religious psychology
6:05
because we tend to think of religious people as people who believe things on faith or without without evidence right
6:11
and so wouldn't the primitive form of that be even more ignorant and even more confident without
6:18
evidence um you know people didn't come to the possession of their world explanations
6:24
by means of science in those days though and in fact they had little if any conception of the
6:30
principles that guide modern science or they didn't understand things like standards of evidence in general i'm speaking in general here
6:37
um and so the world was still a mystery what few truths their traditions handed
6:42
down to you know the people they they clung to these with dear life all the more strongly
6:48
because they knew how ignorant they were and in a world where people lived on the edge of life and death every day you
6:54
know child mortality is very high people were struck down by diseases they had little understanding of they know
7:00
the patterns of the world's climate and all these things are still very opaque um
7:06
if we're going to say these people thought they knew anything with any certainty these people knew that they were
7:12
playthings of the gods the pre-modern religious mindset in my
7:18
view represents quite the opposite of arrogance but rather the acceptance of truths out
7:25
of tradition because it was all you had now you know the greeks did have their
7:32
religious claims just as we do and we'll see plenty of religious references and religious reasoning even within the
7:38
dialogue of the symposium itself but the sense that we had more or less
7:44
explained mankind's place within the physical world and the nature of our origins and the
7:50
nature of our being the sense i would argue is not there and the greek religion could at times be vague and
7:56
self-contradictory and itself mysterious i mean this is why you needed the priests and
8:02
the oracles and the people who are more in touch with these truths and the vagueness of the religion is what led to
8:08
multiple interpretations ever more sophisticated grasping towards some sort of coherent world picture that
8:14
the philosophers engaged in um and so in our attempt to inhabit a more
8:22
ignorant mind state maybe we can perhaps
8:27
let go of some of our prejudices regarding what love is and try to approach the question with
8:33
some epistemic humility let's try to allow love to be mysterious once again
8:40
something divine and beyond human understanding
8:45
that's how the audience i think or any our audience should approach plato's symposium
8:51
and that's the famous socratic dialogue on love it's one of plato's most celebrated
8:58
works it consists of the speeches of several men all of them prominent people
9:04
we have artists philosophers statesmen some of whom are quite famous in
9:09
antiquity and even have name recognition today such as the playwright aristophanes all these men gathered together to drink
9:17
and have a dialogue and at this dialogue all of the men compete in giving speeches in honor of
9:24
eros speeches in the form of a eulogy typically we give a eulogy at a funeral
9:30
in modern culture the eulogy the eulogistic form of uh
9:36
praise in this case doesn't refer to somebody dead necessarily it's just a
9:42
speech of giving praise now said in honor of eros right that's
9:48
who they're praising eros is not an easily translatable term because it's the name for the greek god of love
9:54
but the way the term is used in the text itself includes not just the personage of the god but also the
10:00
meaning of love itself and also ev there's other general qualities and
10:06
connotations that are perhaps not obvious um and so these qualities of love are
10:12
actually easier to understand they're reading the dialogues in the symposium itself actually so one of the central questions in the
10:18
dialogue is the nature of arrows right so to for me to define it here um
10:25
i would be kind of giving giving away the the the ending
10:30
but all the speakers try to describe eros in some way or another um and the penultimate speech is given
10:37
by socrates who explains eros as a universal striving after immortality
10:45
after which alcibiades shows up and gives a final speech and in that speech he declares
10:51
his love for socrates um and actually the speech of alcibiades is unique and
10:56
that rather than eulogizing arrows he eulogizes socrates
11:02
and then after these events all the men drunk fall asleep except for a few who's been you know they stay up all night
11:08
arguing with socrates and so uh they argue through to the morning and that's that's roughly speaking the
11:14
entire narrative contained in the text bunch of guys get together at a party they talk about love everyone falls
11:21
asleep except for socrates and then they go home um
11:27
and they're smart prominent people they're the leading citizens so the first question one may ask is
11:32
whether or not this is a real account of real events uh whether the people who are named in
11:37
the encounter actually said or did the things recorded the short answer is that
11:42
it's unlikely it's unlikely that the events unfolded exactly as plato described them
11:48
and uh you know so we can kind of we can be pretty
11:54
sure that it's some poetic or creative license was taken by plato we'll say
11:59
but um so there's a couple caveats to that i
12:05
mean within the narrative itself the depiction of the course of events
12:11
is given to us in the text openly described as second
12:17
or actually really third hand information so the story of the symposium is given
12:24
to us by apollodorus who says he was not at the suppose at the
12:30
symposium himself but he heard about it an unnamed person asks him to recount it
12:37
as the two are walking from one greek polis to another um
12:42
there are some attempts at uh you know apple odorist tries to date when the symposium must have taken place
12:50
i would suggest that given those that attempt um and the way that it's treated in the
12:55
story i think there was likely some kind of real event that this was loosely
13:01
based on maybe there's a story maybe is it maybe it wasn't a real event maybe there was a
13:06
story that it was based on that's circulated about a symposium attended by socrates and aristophanes and agathon
13:13
and alcibiades and all these famous people you know if such a thing did happen we
13:19
can imagine why that would have been a fabled event right it's like a who's who of prominent people in the region
13:26
and so perhaps some version of it happened in real life or perhaps there was just a story that was told or retold
13:34
but plato surely made his share of artistic decisions in crafting the dialogue
13:40
because as many people have pointed out the dialogue is very structured the order of the speakers
13:47
you know the way that each speech answers the next what is chosen to be omitted right at certain
13:52
points they say and then a couple other people spoke and we don't get to hear their speeches and so the way that it's arranged and
13:59
presented has a has a plan or a blue or an artistic
14:06
blueprint to it which suggests this is very very unlikely that we're getting a
14:11
faithful representation of events you know so perhaps no character speech bears any
14:17
relationship to the reality of what the person actually said maybe
14:22
there was some truth to it on the other hand maybe on the other side the other possibility is there was maybe a great
14:28
deal of truth to what we are reading there's simply no way of knowing whatever the case may be we only have
14:34
the text and so we're simply going to evaluate the text at face value
14:40
and it has philosophical significance regardless i would say of whether it
14:45
really happened or not but i don't know and to me those questions are interesting of to what degree is this a literary
14:52
production to what degree is it uh an actual account of events and i think
14:58
it's probably somewhere in the middle um which is often the case with plato
Mein Lieben
15:05
um but so i've brought up this angle in the story
15:11
of the veracity of the events involved for another reason though because nietzsche himself wrote in an essay
15:17
called mein lieben written upon leaving the academy of forta and on his way to bonn university
15:24
he writes quote i remember with the greatest pleasure the first impressions of sophocles a
15:32
sheila's plato especially in my favorite piece the symposium
15:38
and then the greek lyricists end quote and so nietzsche's favorite piece or his
15:45
liebling strictun this symposium seems to have captured his imagination because it how it ex it displayed an array of
15:52
fascinating characters and thinkers who each expresses himself in his turn
15:57
and so we may remember how also in nietzsche's lectures on the pre-platonic philosophers what seems to fascinate
16:02
nietzsche is this procession of people it's not just a procession of different ideas but
16:08
it's so it's a cast of characters with their own distinctive personalities
16:14
he's just as much interested in the the images of each man and the the life and the character that
16:20
you're beholding as he is in philosophical content he sees each dialogue in the symposium as a sort
16:27
of articulation of the character and the inner life of each man of each speaker
16:33
as much as they are arguments for the nature of love right so revealed within the text are images
16:39
of extraordinary people and we'll come back to this idea as we get into nietzsche's interpretation of plato's symposium
16:46
which we'll mostly cover in the next episode um but since you know it's the nietzsche
16:52
podcast so before we get started i i guess i would it would be i would be remiss if i didn't talk about
16:58
at least in rough outline what nietzsche saw in the symposium and why we're talking about it on the podcast in the
17:04
first place um and you know it was a
The Structure
17:10
his favorite work during a formative time in his life and thought and so one of the things he writes about in
17:17
that essay on plato's symposium that will go into greater detail later
17:22
he sees he sees the same sort of artistic structure um
17:27
many other interpreters have played a symposium c um
17:33
or rather he doesn't see the same story in the same way that many people see a structure nietzsche sees one as well uh
17:39
he's he wrote of how he saw the dialogues building one upon the other to create a
17:44
fully structured complex view of eros he actually uses the metaphor of a
17:50
structure and he says socrates does not refute the previous speeches which is a common claim you will hear about the
17:56
symposium but rather he says socrates continues to build upon the ideas he rounds it off with a dome as the way he
18:02
puts it and so in the symposium he sees this brilliantly structured
18:08
literary composition which balanced and you know synthesized contradictory aspects of eros in a sort
18:15
of dialectic um he does take care to distinguish plato
18:21
from socrates in both of his praise and his criticism nisha does
18:26
um but it's worth noting it's not exactly obvious what level of influence plato had on
18:33
nietzsche certainly this work is of great importance to nietzsche
18:39
um you know we know this from the same in lieben just as much as from a comparative reading of the text itself
18:46
with some of nietzsche's other thoughts but uh the question of how influential the ideas of plato were upon nietzsche's
18:52
thought and the grand scheme of things remains a little bit difficult to answer and the reason for this is
18:58
that plato's works and ideas are like if we were to take a neutral view
19:04
of the situation in classical scholarship at the time
19:10
plato is of central importance i mean he's of great importance to understand still for anyone studying
19:17
philosophy um you know we might remember nietzsche
19:22
discovered schopenhauer around the same time when he began reading plato and plato was one of two
19:30
major western philosophical influences for schopenhauer the other being kant and
19:36
plato is referenced very frequently in world as will and representation as well
19:42
as his theory of ideas or of the forums that's arguably adopted or incorporated by schopenhauer and then nietzsche
19:49
became a philologist and he became versed in all things plato as demanded by that course of education and he in
19:56
fact taught courses about plato um you know and remember what white had said that uh
20:03
all of western philosophy is but a footnote on plato's work so of course nietzsche absorbed and understood the
20:08
ideas of plato that much is very clear there are a few indications though
20:14
that nietzsche's own philosophy was not that profoundly influenced by plato
20:21
uh one is his greater degree of neutrality that he displays toward plato
20:27
in terms of his tone when he talks about plato when contrasted with the way he talks about socrates for example
20:34
socrates is somebody nietzsche has deep complex feelings about you know need to write socrates to confess it frankly is
20:40
so close to me that almost always i fight a fight against him plato is sometimes critically assessed
20:47
sometimes positively assessed and similar to socrates in that regard but there's not the same intensity of
20:53
nietzsche's either positive or negative comments that are given on socrates the same level of attachment and
21:01
like feeling since nietzsche was like struggling with plato or something like that oftentimes plato is mentioned
21:07
just alongside numerous classical authors and philosophers and no special significance is attributed to attributed
21:14
um excuse me to plato so plato is important i'm just not particularly important to
21:22
nietzsche you know another indication of this is how nietzsche redefines the pre-socratic philosophers
21:29
as pre-platonics and so he thus draws a conceptual line
21:34
separating plato's teachers socrates from plato right traditionally people
21:40
loop in socrates and plato together nietzsche divides them so that's an interesting side effect
21:46
of designating them pre-platonics right and what nietzsche says in that essay is
21:51
that plato's the first grand mixed character in greek philosophy which means he was not a purely original
21:58
philosophical creation like the other pre-platonics were you know or or he
22:03
wasn't his own man he wasn't hewn from one stone he drew on multiple past philosophical ideas
22:08
and and other he drew on the ideas of other figures in order to assemble
22:14
uh his philosophical structures whatever you would say
The Grand Mix Character
22:19
so plato is not included among these figures but socrates is
22:24
some people could have argued um nietzsche was somewhat of a grand mix character himself so maybe he kind of
22:31
identified somewhat with plato um i think a lot of this gets into
22:37
speculation right um but uh
22:43
you know one one could even argue that the symposium for example was
22:48
maybe an example of plato being a grand mix type of character right this is what
22:54
plato does plato in the symposium assembles a host of arc typical
23:00
views or arc typical ideas right in the form of people and he puts them into some articulated form
23:07
and but the what does plato bring to the table well he he arranges it right it's his wording it's
23:13
his arrangement it's his artistic touch it's his writing more beautifully than all the poets
23:18
um so i don't know in any case we can say that two things are for sure true plato
23:24
is one of the most frequently cited philosophers in nietzsche's work so that must be said second really only to schopenhauer i
23:31
believe in terms of the number of references and yet nietzsche has far stronger
23:37
feelings towards socrates and andy schopenhauer for that matter when compared to plato
23:44
and in comparison uh his attitude towards plato uh is far more neutral um
23:52
even the you know nietzsche acknowledges plato's importance to the whole of western philosophy thinks plato made
23:57
fatal errors some of the things he really hates like democracy he calls platinism for the
24:02
people so plato gets his share of fire from nietzsche
24:08
but um i think he had stronger feelings for the mentor of plato rather than plato himself
24:15
which if we do identify nietzsche with a grand mix type of character like plato um
24:21
i having stronger feelings towards the mentor of of uh plato socrates right as
24:29
a man who had fatal flaws himself this all this could be an endless
24:34
psychological gold mine um but alas most of it
24:40
is speculation uh if you do want to read more about this i suggest nietzsche's wrestling with plato and sorry plato and platonism
24:48
by thomas brobier i believe that's pronounced b-r-o-b-j-e-r
24:55
it's very informative the view there might be a bit controversial that plato's philosophical ideas were not
25:00
very influential on nietzsche but brobure also makes it clear that nietzsche learned
25:06
from a professor at schult forta who was preoccupied with plato and
25:11
you know he wrote a letter of recommendation for nietzsche to another professor who was similarly
25:17
predominantly concerned with plato so whatever his conclusions brovia lays out the case very effectively plato was just
25:24
in the background at all times in nietzsche's academic career so he's so fundamental
25:29
to greek philosophy that it's not evidence and of itself that nietzsche knew a lot but a lot
25:36
about plato and talked a lot about plato he's just so fundamental to
25:41
um as for nietzsche's complicated relationship with socrates we've talked about that a lot in um
Nietzsche vs Socrates
25:47
the episode nietzsche versus socrates that we did last season um it's usually the criticisms and the
25:54
problematizing of socrates that gets the most attention when people discuss nietzsche's work
26:01
but nietzsche especially in his early writing which would be the time when this was his favorite work
26:08
in the time when he wrote the essay interpreting plato's symposium nietzsche in his early writing uh he spends a
26:15
great deal more time admiring socrates than attacking him and i would put forward the theory that
26:21
much of the the admiration that he has for socrates can be specifically sourced
26:26
to the portrayal of socrates in this work symposium
26:32
and so we're not talking about socrates
26:37
as what would we say in regard to what he represents philosophically
26:44
as to you know what what he introduced into the philosophical world so to speak
26:50
um we're looking at socrates as a personality for one
26:55
and also as like a trans-historical type or as an idea
27:01
right and so nietzsche wrote that socrates
27:08
was the first genuine libens philosoph or philosopher of life
27:13
and this is in the pre-platonic lectures i'm going to read an excerpt from that lecture on socrates
27:21
quotes the means knowledge distinguishes him
27:27
knowledge as the path to virtue differentiates his philosophical character
27:33
dialectic as the single path induction and definition
27:38
the struggle against desire drives anger and so on directs itself against a deep
27:45
lying ignorance he is the first philosopher of life libens philosoph
27:52
and all schools deriving from him are first of all philosophies of life
27:58
a life ruled by thought thinking serves life well among all previous philosophers life had served
28:06
thought and knowledge here the proper life appears as a purpose
28:11
there proper knowledge is seen as the highest thus socratic philosophy is absolutely
28:17
practical it is hostile to all knowledge unconnected to ethical implications
28:23
it is for everyone and popular because it holds that virtue may be taught
28:29
it does not appeal to genius and the highest powers of knowledge previously simple custom and religious
28:36
subscription sufficed the philosophy of the seven sages was merely the vitally practical morality so
28:43
highly esteemed throughout greece made into formulas now the resolution of moral instinct
28:50
enters bright knowledge should be the sole merit but with bright knowledge humanity
28:56
has virtue as well for this is the essentially socratic belief
29:02
that knowledge and morality can join end quote
Nietzsches Criticism of Socrates
29:08
so the description of socrates there in that lecture is very different from nietzsche's criticisms of him that he
29:14
writes later and really if we were to delve into those that would be beyond the scope of this
29:21
episode but to give a short version nietzsche's later critique on socrates involves the accusation
29:28
that the socratic examination of all these previously unquestioned values you know the athenian
29:34
religion and just all the cultural assumptions they made right the lies that support their society
29:40
that project inevitably turns hostile towards life and so these kinds of criticism socrat
29:46
of socrates um nietzsche would begin to
29:52
mount those criticisms as he began to outline his theory of decadence his insight
29:59
that elevating reason and intellect to this kind of supremacy above instinct is
30:04
a kind of weakening of society and this prompted i would i would call
30:10
it a re-evaluation of socrates but here in the passage i just read nietzsche emphasizes a different fact
30:17
the socratic project of using knowledge as a means of living virtuously
30:22
knowledge as a means of learning how to live best and so it's in that philosophical spirit
30:29
that we find the tenor of um socrates's role in
30:34
plato symposium um and so it you know in spite of all the scathing criticisms
30:41
of socrates he would later make we find even all the way at the end of nietzsche's career
30:46
in twilight of idols praise for socrates
30:52
and we find this praise actually in a section attacking socrates which is called the problem of socrates which is
30:58
very fitting for nietzsche this is a section 8 quote
31:03
he was the first fencing master in the best circles in athens he fascinated by appealing to the
31:09
combative instinct of the greeks he introduced a variation into the contests between men and youths
31:16
end quote i think maybe one way of making sense
31:22
of the praise of socrates with the condemnation of socrates
31:28
is that socrates nietzsche is describing there is the socrates of the symposium and the
31:35
one that he really criticizes is the socrates we see in the apology
31:40
right so nietzsche here in problem socrates is praising
31:46
socrates on the basis of what his dueling prowess prowess in terms of the
31:51
battle of wits and that means socrates inspired
31:57
you know young men to more or less completely subordinate themselves to him for one
32:03
and become his followers but also to live lives of philosophy and pursuit of virtue he had power he displayed his power
32:12
we see multiple followers of uh socrates appear in the symposium actually
32:17
and also biotes final speech is a sort of exaltation of the power of socrates
32:23
so socrates in the symposium is not the dreary martyr sacrificing life at the
32:29
altar of truth that nietzsche would later condemn but he's also not
32:36
you know the anti-artistic demagogue that wished to censor art and poetry in the republic and who never understood
32:41
music or art um you know and who was hostile towards the force of greek tragedy
32:48
and that's the socrates you know nietzsche attacks and birth of tragedy and this dialogue at least
32:54
this is where we see him as the liebens philosoph as the
33:00
uh inspiration to nietzsche and socrates indeed inspires those around him with the powers of his intellect
33:07
and appealing to their instinct for competition using his knowledge to show them how best to
33:15
live and so thus offering an inducement to life through the power
33:21
of philosophy i'm going to quote from benjamin joette's introduction to the
33:28
symposium quote the genius of greek art seems to triumph
33:34
over the traditions of pythagorean eliatic or mergarian systems
33:40
and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy has at least a superficial
33:46
reconcilement end quote i think
33:51
that joett's description there it's one of the best you could single sentences anyway that you could give to
33:58
sort of reconcile all of nietzsche's problems with socratism and platonism with his love of this particular text
34:04
ever yearning for an artistic socrates for a force of reason
34:09
that exalts the irrational and mingles with poetry and music right
34:14
here nietzsche finds it and this this in here this is dictum
What is the Symposium
34:21
before we uh jump into the text um i know i've been giving quite a bit of intro but i think it's all very
34:26
important um i just want to clarify the historical point of just what the symposium is
34:32
as a social institution in ancient greece i'm going to draw on a source i used actually in the
34:38
episode about nietzsche and socrates but um yeah so if you listen to that this is a refresher it's from in nt crowley's
34:46
europe european polemic the trojan women and the function of tragedy cambridge
34:51
university press um quote authors as distant from each other as
34:58
theogenous and plato agree in seeing the symposium as a model for the city
35:04
a gathering where men may examine themselves in a playful but nonetheless important way
35:11
here we should note the repeated use of the word and it's a greek word but it means
35:17
touchstone or test to describe the symposium
35:23
moreover at the symposium poetry plays a significant part in teaching the participants the characteristics
35:29
required of them to be good men and quote
35:34
so put simply symposium it's a gathering of men
35:40
usually they are discoursing on a given subject it's a sort of social test
35:47
wine is involved because as is said in the text alcohol loosens inhibitions but there's also an element
35:53
of competition involved there too in terms of how much wine you can drink
35:59
this is also referenced in the text and we must also consider
36:04
that due to the very normal homosexual relationships which were very common
36:09
in ancient greece there could be a sexual element involved in the competition as well one could be
36:15
trying to impress um someone that they would like to you know take as a lover
36:21
or you know they might be planning on making an advance as the night goes on and so this is all to say
36:27
even though this is a social institution that was exclusively male it doesn't mean that the relationships
36:34
between the people at the symposium were strictly platonic no no pun intended
36:41
and in fact we'll see from the events of the symposium that
36:47
you know that's not the case in this symposium so the symposium was a social testing
36:54
ground where men displayed their virtue in their wits that should not escape us in light of the fact that socrates was
37:01
the finest fencing master in all athens in the words of nietzsche
37:07
so next before we uh move further uh let's look at all the
37:12
attendees and just go over them so that you're familiar with all these people i know it's a lot of greek names so
37:18
you may forget who's who but um we'll just go over them so aside from
37:24
socrates who is there we have the host of the party there's agathon agathon is a playwright who is
37:31
celebrating the triumph of his first tragedy
37:36
being performed and he's celebrating it with a party with the symposium and so he's invited
37:42
several of these prominent men proceeding in the order in which the men speak there's phaedras he's a member of
37:49
the socratic circle of philosophers he appears in several dialogues
37:56
and he has an interest in uh you know rhetoric and sophism
38:01
and then there is pausianus an expert in matters of law
38:07
so i'm guessing he would just be like in modern terms a legal scholar or a lawyer
38:13
then there's eric simakis a physician doctor
38:19
then there's uh aristophanes the famous playwright um you know he wrote the birds and the
38:25
frogs and he's aristophanes where we get the uh sang cloud cuckoo land that's from one
38:31
of his plays finally we have the host agathon
38:36
he speaks and then socrates and then finally alcibiades who is a general and a
38:42
statesman and he crashes the party and drunkenly exclaims his love for socrates
38:49
all these men as we've said were prominent among greeks but particularly so are aristophanes socrates and
38:56
alcibiades who are all famous independent of anything in this document right if the symposium didn't exist we
39:02
would still know who all three of those men are and they would all be famous
39:07
the impetus for the speeches about eros is the fact that the um
39:13
the symposium that they're holding is not to include a drinking competition so they they use these speeches to be the
39:19
competition instead most of the men in attendance they agree at the beginning they have all been
39:24
hitting the wine a little too hard recently so then rather than trying to compete with one another
39:30
for who can drink the most they all just decide we'll just drink as much as we want
39:36
and then eric simakis makes the following proposal which i
39:42
will quote in an abridged manner quote
The Proposal
39:48
on several occasions phaedras has said to me an annoyance isn't it awful eric simakis that hymns
39:55
and pens have been made by the poets for other gods but for eros who is so great
40:01
and important to god not one of the many poets there have been has ever made a eulogy
40:08
to this day not one human being has dared to hem eros in a worthy manner
40:14
but so great a god lies in neglect now phaedrus in my opinion speaks well
40:19
in this regard so as i desire to make a comradely loan to please him
40:24
it is in my opinion appropriate for those of us who are now here to adorn the god
40:31
each of us starting on the left should recite the fairest praise of eros that he can and phaedra should be the first
40:38
to begin in as much as he is lying on the head couch and is also the father of the argument
40:44
end quote everyone agrees to this proposal which means that phaedris will speak first
40:51
and phaedras begins by declaring that eros is among the oldest and most
40:57
important of all deities since it is written by hesed that in the order of creation chaos came
41:04
into being first and then earth and then after this eros
41:09
phaedras then invokes that other learned people have agreed with hesiod and that
41:15
all the ancient sources seem to suggest that eros was there near the beginning of all creation
41:21
quote as he is the oldest we have him as the cause of the greatest
41:26
goods and i can hardly point to a greater good from youth onward than to have a good
41:32
lover and for the lover a beloved end quote
41:37
um a note on this so i am actually using multiple translations um for different
41:43
parts of the text so sometimes you may hear eros referred to as eros and sometimes as love
41:50
and then you will also hear this talk of lovers and beloveds there's this idea that the lover is the person who pursues
41:57
and the beloved is the person who um you know is pursued rather right
42:04
and this applies um it seems to especially obtain in the like homosexual sexual relationships
42:13
but we might also consider it in terms of you know the like what are the traditionalist gender
42:19
roles of who pursues and who is pursued in the west would be the men
42:24
traditionally are supposed to pursue and the woman is to be pursued right and that um so this is what they're talking
42:31
about with lovers and beloveds but in theory anyone you know that this is
42:38
anyone could be a lover and anyone else could be a beloved for our purposes but um you know the text takes care to
42:45
distinguish this um the reasoning that phaedrus gives as for
42:51
why having a lover is the greatest good he says he goes on in a speech to talk
42:56
about how it's the honor and the shame that having a lover inspires
43:03
phaedra says that among all our peers and social relations there's no one that it's worse to be
43:09
ashamed of or to be ashamed in front of than one's lover right
43:14
or i guess the way i misspoke initially is true holds true right there's nothing worse than being ashamed of the one you
43:20
love right um so the theory here is that a genuine
43:25
bond of love between significant others for example that improves the person by
43:32
driving them to be honorable or virtuous in the eyes of the one they love and
43:38
avoid being shameful or behaving shamefully in front of them and so phaedras goes so far
43:45
as to say that if a city's defenders are all lovers they will fight harder and
43:50
more honorably to appear honorable and beautiful in the eyes of their loves
43:57
and so phaedras makes his case here quote a real man in love would of course far
44:04
less prefer to be seen by his beloved than by all the rest when it comes to deserting his post or throwing away his
44:10
weapons he would choose to be dead many times over before that happened and to say nothing of leaving behind
44:18
one's beloved or not coming to his aid when he is in danger there is no one so bad that once the god
44:24
eros had entered him he would not be directed towards virtue to the point
44:29
where he is like one who is best by nature and simply as homer said the strength
44:36
that the god breathed into some of the heroes arrows supplies from himself to lovers
44:42
end quote what i find interesting in this passage
Virtue
44:48
of phaedra's first speech it's the view of virtuousness that love elusive you
44:54
know that love brings out right um virtue remember has the moral sense of
45:00
the term um we might also consider the word virtue in the sense of equality or trait
45:06
that something has such as in the sentence um you know by virtue of the fact that the
45:11
earth is tilted on its axis we have seasons right
45:17
and so that's the term virtue as saying because of
45:22
an aspect or quality but we should really it means a strength right in the
45:28
same way we talk about like the healing virtue of an herb it's a positive it tends to be a
45:34
positive quality so a virtue is an aspect of someone's character it's not a moral commandment
45:41
and so here we have the perfect example that phaedrus sees virtue
45:47
and a lover giving his life to protect the one he loves and so we might say this is not necessarily a moral act
45:55
good people as well as bad people could be expected to protect their families or the ones they love
46:01
you know people such as their spouse or their children even up to the point of giving their own life
46:08
as nietzsche says whatever is done out of love occurs necessarily beyond good and evil um
46:15
and so it's this conception of virtue given by phaedras it doesn't partake of that good
46:21
and evil ideology of you know morally determined categories of action
46:28
chosen by a rational deliberating intellect virtue is something that comes from within in fact it actually doesn't
46:34
it comes from a god in this case but it comes from something that's not the rational ego it's the important
46:41
thing so our instincts passions or drives in the greek conception rather than being reduced to some physiological
46:48
explanation are seen as the
46:53
commandments of a god or the the inspiration or the influence of a god
46:59
um that's what compels us when we are stricken by a passion right
47:05
so those drives that we possess that can be regarded as strengths are
47:10
our virtues and as homer says the strength that the god breathes into
47:15
us and so phaedra seems to suggest no matter how bad of a person you are
47:20
and hearing means bad in the greek sense right bad isn't cowardly or weak if the god breathes strengthened to you
47:27
even you will lay down your life in the name of honor that's the power of love
47:33
that phaedrus thinks has been with existence for all time and then he then
47:38
he lists off a bunch of figures from the greek mythos who threw away their lives or did great things for love like uh
47:45
i'll see who gave her life for her husband orpheus who went down to hell to find
47:50
his wife even though he he brings up even though he was failed and he was mocked by the gods for his cowardice he
47:56
still you know he tried and then achilles who avenged his lover protroclass
48:02
and so faders concludes his speech with the sentiment that it's not the object
48:07
of one's love but rather the lover themselves who is close to the divine or closer to the
48:14
divine because whoever loves has the god within him you're a vessel for eros you're close to
48:20
the divine when you're in love and so in faders speech what we have is essentially an
48:26
explanation of love as this divine force that compels us to virtue that's always been here
48:32
and virtue in the greek sense that we've just spoken of so on that account love is a wonderful thing because it strengthens us in that
48:39
regard and this is true regardless of whether our love is even returned or not
48:44
and uh it's like the seizure of of ourselves the seizure of the spirit
48:49
by the power of love that's divine in and of itself and so that's mostly uh that's the gist
48:55
of favor fader's speech that that is his way of praising love
49:00
um apple adoras who is the narrator he then he tells us that some other people spoke
49:07
presumably other guests they've said a bunch of things that are not memorable enough to write down
49:13
uh and then the time came eventually for pausianus to speak possianis is the legal expert
49:21
the next significant figure in the dialogue his first act is to make a distinction
49:27
and to insist that eros is not of a single character
49:33
possionus argues quote phaedras in my opinion it is not noble the way
49:40
the argument has been proposed to us commanding us to eulogize eros in so
49:45
unqualified a fashion for were eros won it would be noble
49:51
but as it is it is not noble for he has not won and as he is not one it is more correct
49:57
that it be declared beforehand which eros is to be praised
50:02
end quote so we began accepting the prompt for what
50:07
it was right we're all going to eulogize eros we're all going to give speeches and praise of love
50:14
with phaedrus giving his praise by arguing that love is a force that betters mankind by
50:21
compelling us to virtue here posseanus questions the premise by suggesting the
50:27
term we're using for the phenomenon which is eros or love is not a single thing we have to make a
50:34
distinction between two things that are being conflated under this label pastyanus invokes a mythological
50:40
justification for his argument there are in the greek mythos two aphrodites
50:47
there is no aphrodite without eros it's for the second premise of the syllogism because they're both gods of love
50:54
and thus uh you know you cannot have two aphrodites without to erote which is the
51:01
plural of eros so there must be two eroti not simply one deity that embodies the force of
51:07
love but two to match the two aphrodites now historically the reason why there are two aphrodites
51:14
has to do with the exchange of religions and cultures
51:19
you know that regional deities which sprung up as gods of individual cities or peoples
51:25
became known around you know wider and wider areas um you know as empires were founded and
51:32
international trade happened and then the influence of different religious cults intermingled and then
51:37
the way that human that the human mind will say
51:43
dealt with the contradictions that the sometimes raised such as when two different peoples have
51:48
two different goddesses of love with similar attributes but different names and that's you know it's quite common
51:55
because people tend to produce a predictable selection of gods whenever pantheism is
52:00
the rule but the way the human mind deals with this is by syncretism what this means is that the two deities
52:07
become merged into the same entity there's a retcon and put it into modern decadent terms for you
52:13
both are simply two faces or two aspects of one being but um
52:19
you know this happened all the time the romans borrowed from the greeks and they borrowed from the etruscans greeks
52:25
states barred from one another from eastern cultures from the persians and so on and so forth it's very common you
52:32
know to for people to say well ares no that's that's our that's just our war god mars you know
52:39
but in any case so then what we have in greek uh religion at
52:44
that time is this conception that there's aphrodite urania and aphrodite pandemia
52:52
these are two commonly known aspects of the goddess aphrodite
52:58
in xenophons symposium xenophon wonders whether there are actually two goddesses or
53:04
whether it's simply two aspects of one goddess which
53:10
you know in consideration of everything i just talked about i guess you could say both are true but here in plato's
53:16
symposium he portrays them as if they're different entities insofar as
53:21
one aphrodite is created by the god uranus and has no elder
53:26
was not actually born and then the other aphrodite is born of zeus
53:31
and uh deioni um the aphrodite that was the daughter of
53:37
uranus was aphrodite urania she came to represent the heavenly otherworldly form of the
53:45
goddess of love representing a love that is spiritual rather than physical or lustful
53:51
if you've seen the famous painting of aphrodite emerging from the seafoam that's aphrodite urania
53:58
now she's contrasted here with aphrodite pandemia daughter of zeus and diony who is said
54:04
to represent the common form of love and so she represents
54:09
physical love and lust so urania is heavenly spiritual love
54:14
pandemia is common physical love um the etymology for pandemia should be
54:20
cleared too you know especially since we've all just lived through a pandemic right
54:25
kids everywhere common and so this is a type of drive if we want to
54:32
keep going with the idea that the gods are describing drives that are powerful
54:38
within the psyche this is a type of drive that inhabits everyone in the sense that physical lust can exist in
54:44
all human beings and it does right it's just a biological fact and so this is perhaps reducible in our
54:50
modern thinking to a biological drive which we mentioned at the beginning of
54:56
the episode but it's the important thing is that the distinction he's drawing here is to
55:03
point out that there is a type of love that everyone experiences and then there is a more
55:09
select type right um what pacianus wishes to distinguish
Love
55:16
that if it's true as phaedra says that loving is a divine thing right and in so far as one is lover
55:22
there's they're in some sense sacred because they're inhabited by a god posseanus is saying that being inhabited
55:29
by eros pandemia right the common physical type of arrows
55:36
which often manifests simply as lust that's nothing special it's not a divine
55:41
thing because this is this god's with everyone this type of love the lower common based type of love what we might
55:48
call our baser instincts that's not in itself anything incredible
55:56
it includes in this type of love it includes love of men but it also as well as love of women love of the body
56:04
love the body rather than the soul you might say in or in modern terms instead of the psyche
56:10
so then um possionus draws attention by contrast
56:15
to the uranian type of eros which is a spiritual type of love and this is the type of love that
56:22
fosters man's eternal improvement that coaxes out mankind's virtue as
56:27
phaedras was talking about pausianus uh argues quote
56:33
it is the pandemian lover who is no good the one in love with the body rather
56:39
than with the soul he is not even for example a lasting lover because he is in love with a thing
56:46
that is not lasting either as soon as the bloom of the body fades
56:51
which is what he was in love with he is often takes wing having made a foul shame of many speeches and promises
56:59
but he who is in love with good character remains throughout life for he is welded to what is lasting
57:07
so our law in good and noble fashion really wants to test these and to have the beloved gratify one group of lovers
57:15
and escape from the others on account of this it exhorts lovers to pursue and beloveds to flee
57:22
setting up a contest so that there may be a test as to which group the lover belongs and which group the beloved end
57:30
quote so he invokes law here
57:35
the impression i get from reading a couple different translations of law in the context possianis the legal expert
57:41
uses it is that it does it does refer to what we would call laws uh in modern times but
57:46
it also refers to what today we might call conventions or moral norms social mores some of
57:54
these indeed may have been backed by force but it seems that this is something that was more enforced in the
58:00
social level rather than the leak the strictly like you know use of state force whatever
58:07
as we think of it today with you know the bureaucracy of litigation and so on any anyway possiana sees the moral
58:12
conventions of the community as created in accord with the dictates of the higher love the
58:18
uranian love not by encouraging lovers not to be promiscuous it encourages a contest wherein lovers
58:26
vie for affections by bettering themselves and committing themselves to all sorts of promises and deeds
58:31
and he takes care to stress as a lawyer might that the way an action
58:37
is carried out has an effect on how we should regard that action you know the intentions and the skillfulness
58:44
with which someone loves should be considered and determining what type of lover they are and this is
58:50
necessary for us to perceive because people who love superficially and who
58:56
are just lustful right will abandon you when your body grows older when you get ugly you know
59:02
promiscuity and shallowness is not something that improves the community or cultivates virtue
59:09
so love done in a promiscuous way is a vice and it's shameful you know
59:15
love done in the uranian sense love of one's character is a virtue and honorable
59:21
um and i think there's definitely just to say it a a double entendre with saying well they're not a lasting lover if they
59:28
love the body it's an interesting sort of almost oxymoronic statement right
59:34
um or an oxymoronic pun that he's doing there because he's saying
59:40
the lover of the body like the lasting lover thing seems to me to be like oh he's you know he doesn't
59:46
last in bed right there's a double end under there but he's saying they're not a lasting lover because they love the body so you
59:52
have to love the soul that's how you become a truly lasting lover um another central element to this
59:58
dichotomy put forward by posse honest is that the pandemian love uh involves
1:00:04
heterosexual relationships as well as homosexual but uranian love in his view is
1:00:09
expressed only between men and really is only perfected in the convergence between
1:00:16
like these virtues that are enforced by the community morality restraint and patience when it comes to relationships
1:00:23
and practice of virtue the pursuer in a sexual relationship
1:00:28
should be tested you know the object of his affection shouldn't be too easy to yield and he even extends his definition of
1:00:36
superficial types of love to the love of power and the love of wealth all of these things are just as fleeting as the
1:00:42
human body right there is the human body's attractiveness and its youth and health are so the true lover is somebody with a
1:00:48
noble mind who possesses um virtue and who pursues other nobly
1:00:55
minded people that's uranium love which is a better higher type of love you know
1:01:02
halcyonis is saying bring me a higher love i wonder how many song lyrics i can quote i've already done power of love
1:01:08
bring me a higher love um next uh aristophanes is about to speak
1:01:14
but he starts momentarily sputtering with hiccups from the wine
1:01:19
so he passes his turn to eric simakis the physician and who was the man who put the
1:01:26
challenge to the group in the first place to make speeches about uh love about arrows
1:01:32
so then eric simakis takes the conversation in an interesting direction he
1:01:37
first thing he does is he expands our focus he expands the question he says that quote
1:01:43
inasmuch as eros is double it is a fine thing to divide him
1:01:48
but that he proceeds not only over the souls of human beings in regard to the beautiful but also in regard to many
1:01:54
other things and in other cases the bodies of all the animals as well as
1:01:59
those things that grow in the earth and just about all the things that are that in my opinion i have come to see
1:02:06
from medicine our art how great and wondrous the god is in his
1:02:11
comprehensive aims both in terms of human things and in terms of divine things
1:02:17
end quote so eric simakis goes on to describe how these two erote
1:02:23
um this dual arrows appears across the whole of nature
1:02:29
it's not a phenomenon that eric simocus thinks should remain limited to human beings
1:02:35
in their romantic relationships so remember this is a competition to see who can best praise arrows right
1:02:41
so the first two species assumes we should praise eros based on eros's um you know bringing out a virtue
1:02:49
within humans um eric simakis then
1:02:55
expands this way out this is his way of praising eros in a fuller way um
1:03:01
he he he takes the definition that had been established of eros the uranian eros is something that cultivates and
1:03:07
induces virtue which is to say another way you could look at it is cultivate strength and
1:03:13
health right you the way we've been talking about virtue in the greek sense eric simicus then
1:03:19
interprets eros here as a means of describing the health or sickness of an entire system
1:03:25
like a physiological system or a biological system and that applies to nature it applies to animals
1:03:31
things that grow in the ground so to plants as well so no longer thinking of arrows as a human phenomenon and no longer
1:03:38
thinking of the human being as this essentialized thing eric simicus takes the conversation into the realm of
1:03:44
physiology which is that's his experiences in medicine the body must be approached as
1:03:49
a whole system and so i've abridged this but here is what eric simakis says on this matter
1:03:56
quote the nature of bodies has this double arrows for the health and the sickness of the
1:04:02
body are by agreement different and dissimilar the art of medicine is to sum it up the
1:04:08
expert knowledge of the erotics of the body in regard to repletion and
1:04:13
evacuation and he who diagnostically discriminates in these things between the noble and base love
1:04:20
is the one most skilled in medicine while he who induces changes so as to bring about the acquisition of one kind
1:04:26
of love in place of another and who in whatever things where there is no love but their needs must be has the expert
1:04:33
knowledge to instill it or to remove it from these things in which it is but should not be would be a good a good
1:04:40
craftsman for he must in point of fact be able to make the things that are most at inity
1:04:47
in the body into friends and to make them love one another the most opposite things
1:04:53
are the most adminity cold and hot bitter and sweet dry and moist and
1:04:58
anything of the sort our ancestor escalios who had the expert
1:05:04
knowledge to instill love and unanimity into these things as the poets hear assert and i am convinced as so
1:05:11
put together our art end quote so you know
1:05:16
he's using the term art and craft roughly interchangeably there
1:05:22
so he's saying uh medicine is the erotics of the body right he he redefines the dichotomy as
1:05:28
it was previously laid out the way it was previously laid out was these two beings
1:05:34
so their their essentialized categories right there's uranian arrows versus pandemian arrows
1:05:40
the way eric semikus um is talking here it really reminds me of yin yang thought and chinese philosophy
1:05:47
here the uranian stands for that which nourishes that's the basis on which eric simakis
1:05:52
speaks of medicine as the art of erotics of providing love for you know for example one of the
1:05:57
body's humors which is to say providing nourishment for one of the humors right we could say doing things that will
1:06:04
um you know the humor is in the old um view of human physiology this is all
1:06:10
obviously well outdated but the idea of these fluids and forces within your body
1:06:15
you can do certain things to nourish them and you've got to keep these forces in balance right
1:06:21
so the uranium is that which nourishes meanwhile the pandemian stands for that which is sick or declining
1:06:28
in the broader sense eric simakis is just pointing out the total system may require a unanimity as he calls it he
1:06:34
cites that as the founding inside of medicine springing from escalios managing a
1:06:40
balance between dry and moist hot and cold and so on all these opposites within the body that could be said to be
1:06:47
either nourishing or depleting depending on the context right and the balance
1:06:52
is this total the balance he wants is this total harmony of the system so we can no longer understand
1:06:58
the uranium the nourishing power of love separate from this understanding of the total harmony at which
1:07:05
it aims right which involves incorporating the pandemian in the proper balance it's all
1:07:12
very chinese in terms of the philosophical approach
1:07:17
you know as we discussed when i talked with hans york muller the greek philosopher heraclitus can be compared to some chinese philosophers and he too
1:07:24
is referenced in eric semakis's speech here because heraclitus wrote of a unity
1:07:29
between opposites and that's who he invokes um and so we may simply note here that with a greek understanding of
1:07:35
medicine the body you know as governed by fluids and humors being in or out of balance whatever
1:07:41
that's outdated but so long as we understand how they thought about medicine we can understand the broader point that eric simakis is making
1:07:48
so really he's taking paucianus's um claims through to their
1:07:53
logical conclusion that whether we judge an action as base or shameful
1:07:58
or as virtuous and honorable it's not contained within the action itself
1:08:04
but based on the context you know as possiana said on our intentions on the results on our
1:08:10
skillfulness in doing so it's the way that one loves that determines whether the result
1:08:16
is of the uranian arrows or the pandemian arrows so one may even nourish some aspect of the body which is
1:08:23
pandemian in nature but if the overall goal is the harmony and flourishing of the organism that's what really counts
1:08:30
and so eric simicus then compares this
1:08:35
you know he he compares it to other crafts right he extends the discussion
1:08:40
to the art of musical composition to the shaping of both rhythm and melody
1:08:45
it's another parallel to the chinese philosophers frankly eric symachus even attributes the turning of the seasons to
1:08:51
alternating cycles of these two erote it's their balance or imbalance that produces hot or cold dry and moist and
1:08:58
when that lack of balance is particularly intense that's where we get things like natural disasters or plagues the like or
1:09:05
in the case of the human body disease so even in matters of religion in terms of man's ritual sacrifices and the art
1:09:12
of divination eric simakis believes the goal is to honor this healthy equilibrium of
1:09:19
the whole that heiress creates that through communion between god and man
1:09:24
maintaining a healthy relationship between the two all these sacrifices and rituals are ultimately
1:09:30
they're accomplished through the healing power of eros and eric simacus's view the powerful philosophical ideas
1:09:37
underneath this proclamation it's through it what he's saying is that it's the skillful maintenance of this
1:09:44
balance moderation that creates virtue and eros is the force that cultivates
1:09:50
this virtue not just in human life but in all things all domains
1:09:56
all aspects of existence and so um eric simakis concludes his speech this way
1:10:03
quote this is the great and overwhelming power that eros as a whole has
1:10:10
and indeed it is rather close to total power but eros concerned with good things
1:10:16
consummately perfected with moderation and justice among us and among gods this has the greatest power and provides us
1:10:22
with every kind of happiness making us able to associate with one another and to be friends even with the
1:10:29
gods who are stronger than we are end quote
1:10:34
um it's interesting that we see there the greek morality come out again right that
1:10:41
uh how how amazing to be friends with somebody who's stronger than you are inconceivable but
1:10:48
um some of the you know this is a i think eric simakis is very impressive and uh
1:10:56
maybe he thought he would end the dialogue with with uh you know by by
1:11:02
the that slam dunk of a speech right but some of the heaviest hitters in the symposium are still to come
1:11:09
um then after him we have the famous playwright um aristophanes
1:11:16
at this point aristophanes is newly recovered from his hiccuping and he begins by suggesting that he
1:11:22
wishes to take the dialogue in a slightly different direction um nevertheless he offers a couple
1:11:29
preliminary remarks that seem to recapitulate to the previous speakers the previous arguments for eros namely
1:11:35
when he says quote eros is the most philanthropic of gods a helper of human beings as well as a
1:11:42
physician dealing with an illness the healing of which would result in the greatest happiness for the human race
1:11:49
end quote so he does directly referenced the previous arguments and he sort of pays
1:11:55
his tribute to them so to speak um he's still speaking of arrows as this
1:12:00
universal force giving rise to that which is virtuous you know cultivating unique strengths we
1:12:05
might say of not just mankind but all the world but aristophanes kind of starts out he
1:12:13
he starts out by chastening the previous speakers that mankind does not truly know the
1:12:18
nature of arrows because man lives in ignorance of the divine and it he says that if we really
1:12:24
understood all that we owe to the healing power of arrows we'd have constructed the greatest shrines and
1:12:29
temples and be making the greatest sacrifices to him and and yet as the participants noted at
1:12:35
the start of the symposium hardly any poet can even be found to compose a pn for poor eros
1:12:41
if he's the greatest of all the gods and responsible for all of our virtue and betterment why is arrow such an
1:12:48
unknown god in the first place well aristophanes says to explain this
1:12:53
quote you must understand human nature and its afflictions
1:12:59
end quote and so as for what this affliction is over mankind which makes us so ignorant of
1:13:06
the true nature of the divine eros aristophanes proceeds to give a
1:13:11
mythological account for the origins of love and mankind it's one of the most famous or perhaps
1:13:17
infamous speeches in the symposium and uh there are some who have considered aristophanes speech rife with
1:13:25
absurdity as it is to be intentionally comedic in nature and many wonder whether aristophanes is
1:13:31
recounting a myth that was actually believed in or whether he himself um you know even believes the things that
1:13:38
he's saying here whether it's just a story um you know after all the man is a
1:13:43
playwright so i'll leave you to decide that for yourselves aristophanes tells us that originally
1:13:50
human beings had three genders there were males females and a
1:13:55
hermaphroditic third gender the name of which he says has been lost sadly
1:14:01
human beings in their original form had two faces twice the amount of limbs they have now twice the number of genitals
1:14:08
um that's how you have the third gender right and so they were so strong and powerful that they threatened to attack
1:14:14
the heavens leading to a debate amongst the gods as to how to deal with them many of them wish to destroy the humans
1:14:21
but others worried over losing the sacrifices that the humans made to the gods finally zeus commanded that mankind be
1:14:29
rent asunder torn in two right and then he sends apollo to go and
1:14:35
reshape human beings after zeus cleaves them all in two right and he sends apollo to go
1:14:41
shape them into a new form with only a single face and only two legs two arms one set of
1:14:47
genitals and so on and so forth and that's the form we're in now
1:14:52
this form of human beings is weaker and was therefore no match for the might of the gods the result is that the human beings now
1:14:59
give twice as many sacrifices to the gods right so the gods get to have their cake and eat it too so it's a zeus's
1:15:05
solution um so uh i'll read here from aristophanes
1:15:11
speech quote after the division the two parts of man
1:15:17
each desiring his other half came together and throwing their arms about one another entwined in mutual embraces
1:15:24
longing to grow into one they were on the point of dying from hunger and self neglect because they did
1:15:30
not like to do anything apart and when one of the halves died and the other survived the survivor sought
1:15:37
another mate man or woman as we call them being the sections of entire men or
1:15:42
women and clung to that they continued to perish so zeus in pity
1:15:48
of them invented a new plan he turned their genitals around to the front for this had not been always their
1:15:54
position for they had previously reproduced in the earth like cicadas
1:15:59
but now could reproduce within one another and after the transposition the male generated in the female in order
1:16:06
that by the mutual embraces of man and woman they might breed and the race might continue
1:16:11
or if man came to man they might be satisfied and rest and go their ways to the business of life
1:16:18
so ancient is the desire of one another which is implanted in us reuniting our original nature
1:16:24
making one of two and healing the state of man each of us when separated having one
1:16:31
side only like a sliced filet of soul is but the indenture of a man and thus he
1:16:36
is always looking for his other half end quote
1:16:42
it's fascinating to me about this story and the speech of aristophanes
1:16:48
seems to me as if he takes us a few steps backward right out of the ever expanding scope of the discussion
1:16:55
um the discussion is expanding so that aeros is becoming this divine force over
1:17:00
all things and then aristophanes takes us back to the discussion of romantic love between
1:17:05
human beings and tells us a story that more or less only
1:17:11
explains it's like an origin myth for romantic love between humans um
1:17:16
you can see from just the text of the speech itself it doesn't it doesn't actually account for all the things that
1:17:21
eric simakis was talking about in just the speech before him but his pretext for giving this
1:17:29
part of the speech is that it's to explain why we're not as strong and smart and powerful as we used to be and
1:17:34
that's why we no longer know the ways of arrows um
1:17:39
but the story itself it's mythical um it's fantastical it's absurd as we
1:17:45
said and it seemingly excludes arrows from the discussion for the most part right if you look at the actual
1:17:51
characters and motivations the real origins of love is something created out of the machinations of zeus
1:17:57
and the gods and their war with mankind love as mankind experiences it in this
1:18:03
fable is a result of being split in two by means of zeus and uh it's this pursuant then feeling
1:18:10
of or this consequent feeling of yearning we have to be made whole again to become our full selves again
1:18:18
but there's a clever way in which this story is sort of a response to eric semicus um
1:18:23
and you know the eric semakus's framework that the power of eros is found in the unanimity between apparent
1:18:29
opposites the synthesis of things which are apparently at odds aristophanes presents a story in which
1:18:35
people are literal other halves for the seeking of the sense of wholeness
1:18:41
outlined in the abstract and eric simakis's speech takes on an aspect that's so literal
1:18:46
that it becomes absurd but i would argue that aristophane aristophanes he's taken consideration of
1:18:53
the symposium so far um he's which has you know concluded in the idea
1:18:58
that eros cultivates virtue by bringing out wholeness and he represents what's been said in a literal
1:19:04
a literalized narrative we could say the narrative takes into account things like the sexual impulse that's what we might
1:19:11
call the pandemian aspect of the narrative which is explained by the
1:19:17
absurd literal details of zeus arranging human beings genitals
1:19:23
making the seeking of wholeness expressed in the sexual impulse and coming together in a physical sense
1:19:29
but aristophanes counterbalances that pandemian part of the representation
1:19:35
he's giving us further in his speech he argues quote
1:19:41
no one would be of the opinion that it was sexual intercourse that was wanted
1:19:46
as though it were for this reason of all things that each so enjoys being with the other in great earnestness
1:19:53
but the soul of each plainly wants something else what it is it is incapable of saying but
1:19:59
it divides what it wants and speaks and riddles if hephaestus with his tools were to
1:20:04
stand over them as they lay in the same place and were to ask what is it that you want human beings to get for
1:20:10
yourselves and from one another and if in their perplexity you were to ask again is it this you desire to be with one
1:20:17
another in the same place as much as possible and not to leave one another night and day
1:20:23
for if you desire that i am willing to fuse you and make you grow together into the same thing
1:20:29
so that though too you would be one and as long as you lived you would both live together just as though you were
1:20:36
one and when you died there again in hades you would be dead together as one
1:20:42
instead of two we know that there would not be even one who if he heard this would refuse
1:20:49
end quote and so as absurd as aristophanes conceit is even here i
1:20:57
mean in this literal example being fused by a blacksmith into a single body but what he's hitting at is is the idea
1:21:04
of being together even in death even beyond death that is i think almost indisputably what
1:21:09
lovers want and this togetherness cannot be reduced to the desire for sex or for lust or for physicality
1:21:17
and in this way eristophanes even manages to reach the same transcendent place
1:21:23
of discussion that the dialogue has been aiming at so far and that he ultimately shows love to be something which goes
1:21:29
beyond physical attraction beyond the body beyond sexual reproduction even beyond
1:21:35
death a desire for wholeness for togetherness with one's other half
1:21:41
is far above anything like physical lust it's aiming for that sense of unanimity of wholeness of that equilibrium
1:21:49
so we have in these first four speeches this progression which i will
1:21:55
recap for you phaedrus is the one who sparks off the discourse the speech he gives is more or
1:22:01
less in line with the standard formula of a eulogy
1:22:06
it's also another name for this type of speech is an encomium so this the type of speech they would
1:22:12
give it includes the origin of the subject the noble genealogy of the deity you know who's being praised as well as
1:22:18
a list of the good qualities or virtues his habits and way of life and finally the achievements that type of speech was
1:22:25
promised on the idea of uh reciprocity on the idea that the ancient greek would gain the favor of
1:22:32
the god by eulogizing them and so that's roughly the structure of phaedra's speech but in giving it he
1:22:38
outlines the scope of the discussion and that he ends up asserting intentionally or not
1:22:44
that the definitive feature of love love understood here as a force as a divine
1:22:49
being within mankind um is that lover lovers and their beloveds will die for one another that's
1:22:56
how he praises the power of eros but here the idea is only vaguely outlined because phaedras is treating
1:23:01
eros um as a god as a force of the passions affecting or motivating human beings
1:23:09
um and his idea of it is undifferentiated for example offering no distinction between the
1:23:15
force that motivates physical lust and the force that forges these deep emotional spiritual bonds
1:23:22
possesses speech accounts for that distinction by establishing the higher and lower arrows
1:23:27
while still remaining on the level of analysis where eros is a
1:23:32
force that only manifests in human beings and only in terms of human social life but he establishes that there's the type
1:23:39
that's common and physical and another which is spiritual and that he associates with with the
1:23:45
type of relationship one may have with a wise mentor from whom they learn not simply romantic
1:23:52
sexual love but a love based on enrichment of the soul eric simakis's speech takes this
1:23:58
principle and applies it to all of nature the entire physical world so we might say that the force of arrows as
1:24:03
we've been examining it manifests in these two aspects a higher and a lower aspect in human life but
1:24:10
that eros itself is a much broader force that governs things beyond the human um eric semikus also talks about good
1:24:17
and bad types of love continuing the distinction set up by posseanus um but because love is no longer simply
1:24:24
an attraction between human beings but something that acts in the whole world the understanding of eros gives way to
1:24:29
an understanding of the external world and the skills that help us master the external world
1:24:36
um so accordingly while pausianus may say that the romantic partner should gratify
1:24:42
moderate lovers but not narcissistic self-indulgent lovers eric simakis says that the expert such
1:24:49
as the doctor or the priest or the musician or the craftsman must gratify moderate desires
1:24:56
and not become victim to a self-indulgent desire just as you know paseonus advises us not
1:25:02
to become victim to a self-indulgent lover um and arxemicus believes this or he
1:25:08
stresses this point because he believes the goal of the expert in any field is to create harmony
1:25:13
and he relates this to the function of eros [Music] aristophanes speech then offers an
1:25:21
imagistic and mythological explanation that nevertheless continues this line of
1:25:26
thought and that aristophanes presents love as an attempt to reconstruct the original unity that
1:25:32
lovers come together to create this harmony this synthesis balancing restoration of healthy oneness
1:25:40
and so even though he takes our focus back from the role of eros as a universal force acting on the whole
1:25:45
world his myth fleshes out the nature of how eros acts on human beings
1:25:51
given the understanding we have developed in the in all of the three speeches since phaedra's speech
1:25:57
humans wish to live a shared life with one another such they're even willing to die for the ones they love why
1:26:04
because it's the nature of all things to seek an original harmony and this is the force of arrows upon the whole world
1:26:10
and the way this manifests in human beings is our desire for closeness and
1:26:16
companionship with one another this attraction this devotion to one another to out of a desire to become homeless
1:26:22
whole again and that even involves wanting to die and go to the underworld with them rather than be separated
1:26:29
um after the speech of aristophanes there's some brief dialogue and discussion between the various participants before
1:26:35
agathon takes the center stage to give his speech but the final three speech speeches
1:26:41
excuse me alas i will be covering these next week in the second part of the episode because
1:26:47
you see much like the original powerful human beings of old
1:26:53
this podcast episode may have been born three hours long and two episodes worth of content together
1:26:59
in a single unity but it was just too powerful that way so
1:27:04
i not unlike zeus had to split it into two
1:27:09
and i know none of my audience will be happy until the first episode is reunited with second and the whole lecture finally finds
1:27:16
wholeness but for that you'll have to come back next week here at the nietzsche podcast
1:27:22
thanks for listening signing off throughout the first four speeches of
1:27:28
the symposium the speakers continue grasping forward through a series of
1:27:34
different perspectives and in the process they gradually produce
1:27:39
a more complete view of the god eros eros is the god who was understood by
1:27:44
the greek culture to be the force of love as we talked about last week and eros manifests within mankind
1:27:52
wherever people become stricken with love moving from
1:27:57
fedras's initial speech to that of pasianus eric symacus and aristophanes
1:28:03
an image begins to form of the god which becomes more refined and complex as we continue
1:28:11
each man adds some element working from the premises of the previous speakers
1:28:16
whether those premises are agreed upon or refuted but either way they work off of the
1:28:22
premises of the previous speakers in order to refine the idea of what the power of love actually is and therefore
1:28:29
how it is that the god of love eros is indeed a great god which was the purpose of the speech they're giving the
1:28:36
eulogy the encomium right it's a style of speaking um designed to praise a deity
1:28:43
now i should note here not everyone agrees with the idea that these speeches build upon one another
1:28:49
if you read the penguin classics edition of the symposium for example and read the introduction by christopher gill
1:28:55
you'll get the viewpoint that the speeches which appear before the speech of socrates you know
1:29:00
they're subpar they're confused they're vague they're pretentious or they're just you know they're flat
1:29:06
out wrong the underlying argumentative thrust of the symposium
1:29:11
um to christopher gill is that it's the intention of ridiculing the other interlocutors at the event in
1:29:18
order to glorify socrates right that was what he would allege was trying
1:29:23
to do but this interpretation of the speeches so far that i've given a progression wherein each man works
1:29:30
together to bring forward a more complete picture of eros is not my own but friedrich nietzsche's and we know
1:29:37
because he writes about it in the essay on the relationship of alcibiades speech
1:29:42
to the rest of the speeches employed a symposium which nietzsche wrote in 1864 which that
1:29:48
would have been the last year that nietzsche studied at shop forta and at this point he was firmly on the
1:29:54
philological track and immersed in his studies of the greeks it's a very short essay and so we'll
1:30:01
probably end up reading through most if not the whole thing over the course of this episode but
1:30:08
at this point before we move on to the last three speeches i want to give you the story so far uh in nietzsche's words
1:30:15
and this is from the second paragraph of the essay translated by andy davis quote
1:30:21
phaedra's speech sketches only the area in which the question moves he describes eros as the oldest god and
1:30:29
as the author of the greatest goods naturally i pass over the meaning of the individual speeches for the personality
1:30:36
of the speakers and emphasize the fundamental thought passionist explains eros the heavenly
1:30:43
god as love which has as its purpose the active and passive refinement of
1:30:49
human beings whereas the first two speakers present love only in its effect on human beings
1:30:56
eric simicus broadens the meaning of eros to include the universal life of nature
1:31:02
aristophanes says that a natural necessity lies at the root of eros
1:31:08
the law of attraction end quote and the word for law of attraction is
1:31:15
volvervand shaft so
1:31:20
nature sees each speaker working in this procession to take the topic and refine it or to broaden it refocus it basically
1:31:27
we could say but you know not insofar as they simply refute or disagree outright with one
1:31:33
another and nietzsche thinks that a central principle is at work in each speech which represents the personality
1:31:41
of the person speaking and the fundamental thought behind their speech so for example it's only natural
1:31:46
that eric simakis should broaden eros to include the world of nature which you know as that's the world of biology and
1:31:52
physiology and thus within his domain as a practitioner of medicine and it's only natural that aristophanes
1:31:59
the playwright should offer us a fanciful you know comedic story in the place of his own speech
1:32:06
but the progression again is phaedras establishes the topic pausianus
1:32:11
talks about eros in terms of love not just in terms of the god makes the distinction of higher and lower love
1:32:18
eric simakis expands the concept to universal terms that go beyond humanity and finally aristophanes
1:32:24
defines those universal terms by characterizing the universal eros
1:32:30
albeit in an allegorical way as the wolver von shaft or the law of
1:32:35
attraction so in the story which we'll now continue with the next speaker is the host of the
1:32:42
party agathon whom we have not heard from yet before we get into his speech in depth
1:32:49
uh i'm going to read what nietzsche how he defines what agathon's contribution to the dialogue is quote
1:32:55
agathon finally calls eros the love of the beautiful which brings forth everything good and
1:33:02
great in nature and art everywhere end quote
1:33:08
so established before agathon's speech we have the idea of arrows as this force that seeks to reconstruct an original
1:33:15
unity or an ideal harmony across all of nature expressed as the universal law of attraction
1:33:22
then agathon comes forth and looks beneath this law of attraction at least
1:33:28
this is what he wants to do in his speech and as nietzsche says he defines it as love of the beautiful and he
1:33:33
begins his speech notably by challenging the previous speakers and suggesting they have not praised
1:33:40
eros as thoroughly as possible because they have praised him for his effect on human beings
1:33:46
rather than speaking of the character of eros himself so they have talked of the you know
1:33:52
the work of arrows the effect of arrows the manifestations of arrows how people are willing to die for their lovers
1:33:58
how one who pursues an art or a craft while possessed by eros will seek to
1:34:03
create that irritant harmony or how human beings want nothing more than to find you know closeness and
1:34:10
companionship with one another but this is all discussion of ourselves and not the god himself
1:34:16
right this is agathon's critique of the speakers who come before him it's his way of suggesting that he's
1:34:22
speaking of something even more fundamental than this universal law of attraction
1:34:28
that um aristophanes puts forward because you could say that aristophanes
1:34:34
is again speaking of the effect right the key to understanding this universal law of attraction is within the
1:34:40
attributes and the inner character of the god himself and so he declares he will speak of arrows himself of the
1:34:46
inner nature of eros and this nature is the love of the beautiful
1:34:52
agathon's speech therefore is a penetration into deeper depths into the foundation of all those good and
1:34:57
praiseworthy effects on humankind this law of attraction in terms of its inner character
1:35:05
we might call it a will to beauty to use nietzsche in terminology agathon
1:35:10
also goes on in his speech um to quibble with the other speakers on a few other points
1:35:16
um perhaps the most significant uh is his first major quarrel which is with
1:35:22
phaedrus because phaedras claimed that eros was the oldest deity predating all
1:35:27
of the major pantheon of ancient greece um and that without his force acting
1:35:32
upon this world there would not have been procreation um that you know heiress is responsible
1:35:38
for um all of these early deeds of the gods and agathon says he does not believe
1:35:43
this and that if love if it was love that led to the primordial generations of gods quote
1:35:51
the gods would not have imprisoned or castrated each other or done those many other acts of violence end quote
1:36:00
referencing to sordid stories and greek myths agathon's conclusion is that we have
1:36:06
confused love with what he calls necessity arguing quote
1:36:11
the things that gods did to each other in ancient times which hesiod and parmenides report happened because of
1:36:18
necessity and not love end quote therefore he argues that love is not the
1:36:24
oldest among the divinities but the youngest and furthermore that eros is always and
1:36:29
eternally the youngest among the gods um
1:36:35
so again nietzsche's argument in interpreting this is certainly not that the speakers don't
1:36:40
disagree with one another right because agathon very clearly disagrees with the view of phaedras here
1:36:46
and he overturns one of the pillars the main pillar you could say of phaedra's praise
1:36:53
agathon then proceeds to give praise to the deity himself and speak of love's characteristics
1:36:59
as one who dwells in the softest things and in the softest hearts as one who's
1:37:04
infinitely graceful and because of his eternal youth you know eros is also supremely beautiful
1:37:10
and so the image here is of arrows as beautiful and that one that inhabits the beautiful
1:37:17
you could say that within agathon's framework beauty itself is a manifestation of eros
1:37:23
in the course of his speech where he argues to correlate love with beauty he wishes to associate eros with everything
1:37:29
beautiful and so he says quote his beauty of complexion is shown by the fact that he spends his time among
1:37:36
flowers love does not settle on a body or mind or anything that has no bloom or has
1:37:43
lost its bloom but when he finds somewhere full of bloom and fragrance there he settles and
1:37:49
stays end quote um you know the idea of something
1:37:54
blooming something in bloom that's a very rich metaphor because it speaks to us just as much of the
1:38:00
beauty of youth as a freshness you know having vigor vitality something freshly
1:38:05
coming into being something flowering right and so agathon
1:38:11
he addresses the speech as some of the other interlocutors besides fredris as well
1:38:17
so he argues that eros possesses the supreme virtues of justice of moderation
1:38:22
and of wisdom when he speaks of the moderation of eros he alludes to the speech of eric symacis
1:38:29
then he says that to honor his own expertise just as eric simakis honored his that eros quote is so skilled a poet
1:38:38
that he makes others into poets end quote and he goes on to say quote certainly as
1:38:44
regards the production of living things who will deny that it is by love's skill
1:38:50
that all living things come into being and are produced as for expertise in art or craft don't
1:38:56
we know that whoever is taught by this god ends up being famous and conspicuous while whoever is untouched by the god is
1:39:03
obscure end quote so again you know here agathon
1:39:09
capitulates to the claims of other speakers that aeros is responsible for not just human sexuality but the
1:39:14
production of all living things and also the production of all sort of creative works
1:39:20
all enterprises of arts and crafts he goes on to say that apollo himself was a student of eros
1:39:26
but again the reorientation that agathon has in mind is to focus on the essence of the god himself
1:39:33
on the traits and qualities of eros and on the inner character of eros and thus agathon reinterprets these claims by
1:39:38
suggesting what what it means to say that eros creates these things as to say the love
1:39:44
of the beautiful created these things and that's what it means when the muse enters the art artisan or the craftsman
1:39:52
he gains the perspective to see and bring forth the beautiful to seek after the beautiful
1:39:58
it's through that love of the beautiful that the harmony that eric simakis spoke of is created so again eric simicus
1:40:05
in agathon's view was merely speaking of the effect here he's speaking of the inner character the inner nature of eros
1:40:11
and so agathon concludes as such for his speech quote
1:40:17
so it seems to me phaedras that love is himself supreme in beauty and excellence
1:40:23
and is responsible for similar qualities in others i feel moved to express this in verse
1:40:30
and say that he is one who makes peace among humankind and windless calm
1:40:37
at sea rest for the winds and sleep for those distressed
1:40:43
love drains us of estrangement and fills us with familiarity
1:40:48
causing us to come together in all shared gatherings like this and acting as our leader in festival chorus and
1:40:55
sacrifice he includes mildness and excludes wildness
1:41:01
he is generous of goodwill and ungenerous of ill will he is gracious and kindly gazed on by
1:41:08
the wise admired by the gods craved by those denied him treasured by those
1:41:14
enjoying him end quote so it seems
1:41:19
agathon has knocked it out of the park and tied together all of these disparate threads of the
1:41:25
many eulogies given and the narrator tells us that after he finishes speaking there is an electric
1:41:33
response to agathon's speech remember this man is a well-loved poet
1:41:38
and playwright and you know he just had his first tragedy performed seems the man is on fire you know he's just uh
1:41:46
he's uh displaying once again that he is this great poet um in front of this very
1:41:53
um well you know respected cons conspicuous company here
1:41:59
and so it says in the text quote after agathon had finished his speech
1:42:04
aristodemus said there were shouts of admiration from everyone present because the young man
1:42:10
had spoken in a way that reflected well on himself and on the god end quote
1:42:16
um out in the bit there about aristodemus said um it's you know the narrator
1:42:21
apollodorus recounting what he heard from maurice to demons who was actually there
1:42:26
um but of course you know so the speech of socrates is coming next and given that this is a dialogue of
1:42:33
plato this should probably clue you into the fact that agathon is about to be made to
1:42:39
look rather pedestrian in comparison socrates begins by praising the speech
1:42:45
of agathon and expressing a sort of ironic hesitation at having to follow agathon's
1:42:51
speech this is why socrates is called the great ironist by nietzsche he often gives praise of the intelligence or abilities
1:42:58
of others that appears to be sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek you know
1:43:04
but so socrates expresses here he doesn't think he can measure up to the tremendous speeches that have
1:43:10
already been given says he cannot guarantee he will have a good speech if he's forced to continue in the style
1:43:17
of eulogistic speaking and argues that he must approach his speech in a slightly different way
1:43:24
he says that if the goal is merely to offer praise of arrows this imposes a limit on the type of things that each
1:43:29
man can say means that the appearance of praise must at all times be given regardless of whether such praise is
1:43:35
true socrates of course cares more about whether what he says is true than
1:43:40
whether what he says offers praise uh and so he says he'll only give his speech if he's allowed to
1:43:46
be completely honest and everyone present agrees because of course they want to hear what
1:43:52
socrates has to say who wouldn't and he then asks uh if he can ask a few questions of agathon before he begins
1:43:59
speaking uh socrates sort of socrates's mo and everyone agrees to this as well
1:44:06
socrates starts therefore by cross-examining agathon in order to establish a few
1:44:12
uh basic premises for the argument he's about to make he argues that somebody cannot be called
1:44:18
a father unless they are a father to someone a father to a child same is true of a mother or a brother or
1:44:25
a sister any familial relationship right one must be a brother to a siblings
1:44:30
somebody with no siblings therefore can't be a brother and so on and so forth
1:44:36
you know one is defined as being this thing this role on the basis of a relationship that exists
1:44:42
to someone else socrates gets agathon to agree with all these premises and then socrates asks
1:44:48
the million dollar question quote now try to tell me about love socrates
1:44:55
said is love the love of nothing or the love of something
1:45:00
of something undoubtedly for the moment socrates said keep to
1:45:06
yourself and bear in mind what love is of but tell me this much
1:45:11
does love desire what it is the love of or not
1:45:16
yes he said think about it socrates said surely it's not just probable but
1:45:23
necessary that desire is directed at something you need and that if you don't need something you don't desire it
1:45:30
i think so too said agathon that's right now would anyone who was tall want to be
1:45:37
tall or anyone who was strong want to be strong well that's impossible according to what
1:45:43
we've agreed already yes because no one is in need of qualities he already has
1:45:50
end quote socrates then goes on to elaborate about why it is wanting something you already have is an
1:45:56
incoherent idea he really hammers this home which agathon continues to agree with
1:46:02
we'll skip over the length the arguments in that respect to where this is all summarized succinctly by socrates at the
1:46:09
end quote desire and love are directed at what you don't have what isn't there and what you
1:46:15
need end quote socrates extracts agreement from agathon
1:46:21
on this point and then continues to press on the argument he says agathon's already agreed that love is love of the
1:46:26
beautiful and that the affairs of gods are arranged according to the principle of
1:46:31
the love of beautiful things and that no one could love what it is that is ugly and agathon agrees to all these points
1:46:38
as well and finally socrates makes the famous greek association of the beautiful with
1:46:44
the good and gets hackathon to agree to this also that being in need of
1:46:49
beautiful things necessarily means being in need of good things for if what was beautiful was not good
1:46:56
for us we would of course not value it and we wouldn't seek after it um and after all agathon cannot really disagree
1:47:02
with him on this point because all of the men present have made speeches asserting the idea
1:47:08
that eros is behind all of these good things in mankind that was sort of what they were compelled to do by the fact
1:47:14
that they were giving speeches where they were they had to praise eros right and so that you know eros this will to
1:47:21
beauty is this force making mankind better and more virtuous and so of course it's good but all this
1:47:27
means inevitably that given the other arguments that hackathon has been led to
1:47:32
agree with by socrates that if eris is the love of the
1:47:38
beautiful aeros must not himself possess beauty
1:47:43
he can't be beautiful himself because loving the beautiful desiring the
1:47:49
beautiful means you don't have beauty and by that token that means he must not possess what is
1:47:54
good either and so in the cross-examination before socrates's speech even begins
1:48:02
socrates uh has more or less said that all of the things everyone said praising eros about how good eros is how
1:48:09
wonderful eros is that eros is not good and so it's not a very promising start
1:48:15
for socrates but you know so in any case socrates has gotten agathon
1:48:20
the speaker who everyone praised um most hurtfully after his speech he's gotten
1:48:26
him to agree that the central ideas of his speech are wrong that eris is himself not beautiful not
1:48:31
virtuous not good um and if he represents the seeking after
1:48:37
those things and he can't possess them um and so we can understand why people tend to interpret socrates as tearing
1:48:44
down the speeches of the men who spoke after him um
1:48:49
because it would seem that unfortunately all of their premises have been undermined
1:48:54
agathon goes along with all this as people usually do with socrates saying that he can't argue with him
1:49:01
and who can blame agathon who would want to argue with socrates to which socrates responds quote
1:49:08
it's the truth you can't argue with my dear friend agathon it's not at all difficult to disagree
1:49:15
with socrates and quote so socrates has uh held to his promise
1:49:22
to speak the truth um even if it would seem to violate the need to give praise to eros and uh
1:49:29
so where can socrates proceed from here socrates's next move uh
1:49:35
upon beginning his speech is to use ethos he's already used the path of logos as
1:49:42
you know the weapon of his criticism right but here he appeals to a spiritual authority
1:49:48
bringing in the voice of diatoma of mantanea de atoma is a priestess of eros that
1:49:54
socrates says he once had a dialogue with when in the past he went to her in order
1:49:59
to inquire about the nature of eros so given that the symposium is presented
1:50:05
as a second or sorry a third hand account already so it's being told to the audience by
1:50:11
apollodorus who heard it from aristodemus socrates now makes it a fourth hand account as we're now hearing
1:50:18
from apollodorus what aristodemus heard socrates say that he heard
1:50:24
diatoma say so this has led people to endlessly speculate as to whether or not diatoma
1:50:31
is even real maybe she didn't even exist and socrates made her up maybe she's just a rhetorical technique right
1:50:37
or maybe plato made her up because maybe plato made up the entire dialogue
1:50:43
or maybe these are all entirely real people and we're just getting a fourth hand account
1:50:49
we'll leave all of these impossible to resolve puzzles aside for the purposes of the
1:50:54
podcast whatever the reality of the situation the effect of presenting his argument as
1:51:01
a recounting of a dialogue with dayatima of mantanea is that socrates can therefore
1:51:07
evade the sorts of mental obstacles or mental blocks that people might have and
1:51:12
that might arise if his arguments were considered to be just blasphemous i mean
1:51:18
he's just suggested eros is not good or young or beautiful and now he can elaborate on what it means
1:51:24
while offering the arguments as if they're the words of an oracular priestess someone who's not by any means
1:51:30
a blasphemer but you know a no a knower of the holiest most secret truths
1:51:37
the effect again whether this is a genuine dialogue that socrates presents or not it may well be
1:51:42
the effect is to clue his audience into the fact that he does not intend to make an attack upon eros this is
1:51:49
mostly my opinion here but um you know he's redefining the terms of
1:51:54
the conversation and he's trying to indicate to everyone who is thus far spoken as to how the words they have uttered
1:52:01
have come very far short of their reality
1:52:06
some interpreters have also suggested this could be socrates's way of appealing to the pride of agathon and to
1:52:11
the pride of the other speakers for socrates is saying look agathon the same arguments that i just put to you
1:52:18
were put to me by diatoma i used to think the same wrong things that you thought i was just as ignorant as all of
1:52:24
you are but diatoma set me straight therefore you know it's not that i'm this
1:52:29
particularly clever man in comparison to you but i was outwitted by someone else who had an insight into the same truth
1:52:36
right and i'm just sort of relating what they said and so ironically so i think that does i think that's a
1:52:42
completely valid argument that it serves to to um undercut the block the mental block of
1:52:48
people's pride but it's this this kind of magnanimity that socrates
1:52:55
shows that ironically serves to further set socrates above everyone else
1:53:01
um and that's a sort of a clever it's an intellectual or rhetorical judo trick that socrates often pulls
1:53:09
so socrates then relates what was said between himself and the priestess effectively what socrates does he
1:53:15
continues the dialogue that he began with agathon right only now he's doing the dialogue all by himself and now he's
1:53:22
relating a dialogue that he had and it roughly corresponds to like socrates
1:53:28
is basically in agathon's role and diatoma is in the role of socrates it's basically as if socrates said well okay
1:53:34
clearly you're just you know agreeing to whatever i say whatever i say because you want to argue with me so i'm just
1:53:39
going to continue to dramatize a dialogue and relate to you the story of what
1:53:45
diatoma told me so socrates now goes on relating this dialogue
1:53:51
quote i said what do you mean diatoma
1:53:57
is eros ugly and bad then she said what blasphemy
1:54:02
do you think that anything which isn't beautiful must necessarily be ugly i certainly do
1:54:10
and must anything that isn't wise be ignorant haven't you realized that there's something between wisdom and ignorance
1:54:18
end quote skipping a little further down in the passage tayatama elaborates
1:54:24
quote don't think that what isn't beautiful must be ugly and that what isn't good
1:54:29
must be bad in the same way when you yourself agree that eros is neither good nor beautiful
1:54:35
don't suppose he must therefore be ugly and bad but something in between the two
1:54:41
end quote and so in the course of the dialogue diatoma then gets socrates to admit that
1:54:48
if eros is not in the possession of good and beautiful things then he cannot be a god
1:54:53
because after all eros is in need of or in the business of seeking after
1:54:59
good and beautiful things which means he doesn't have them which means he's not good or beautiful in and of himself and
1:55:05
socrates also agrees it would be blasphemous to say that a god could exist who is not beautiful and
1:55:11
happy which means of course eros cannot be a god and so once again socrates protests
1:55:17
quote but what could eros be a mortal
1:55:22
far from it diatoma answers what then
1:55:28
like those examples discussed earlier he's between mortal and immortal [Music]
1:55:33
what does that make him diatoma he is a great spirit socrates
1:55:39
everything classed as a spirit falls between god and human
1:55:45
what function do they have i asked they interpret and carry messages from
1:55:50
humans to gods and from gods to humans they convey prayers and sacrifices from
1:55:56
humans and commands and gifts in return from gods being intermediate between the other two
1:56:03
they fill the gap between them and enable the universe to form an interconnected whole
1:56:09
they serve as the medium for all divination for priestly expertise and sacrifice rituals and spells
1:56:17
and for all prophecy and sorcery gods do not make direct contact with
1:56:23
humans they communicate and converse entirely through the medium of spirits
1:56:29
someone whose wisdom lies in these areas as a man of the spirit while wisdom and other areas of
1:56:35
expertise and craftsmanship makes one merely a mechanic there are many spirits of very different
1:56:41
types and one of them is eros end quote
1:56:47
and so now we finally see here how socrates continues the arguments of the previous
1:56:53
speakers while completely reinterpreting what it is that all of them have been speaking about
1:56:59
socrates reframes the discussion we're not here to give praise to a god because eros is not a god at all
1:57:06
pharaohs were a god it would be a blasphemy to define him as the love of the beautiful
1:57:11
which is the conclusion that the series of speeches had arrived at before socrates even uttered a word by the way
1:57:17
they arrived at something which socrates exposes as being blasphemous
1:57:23
that like the the saying the premises underlying all the things that you have said that you have all built up to
1:57:30
is is actually to denigrate the god of eros right because if he's if ultimately the
1:57:36
foundation of all this is the love of the beautiful then you're saying that eros is an ugly god
1:57:42
but the this is why socrates d personifies eros
1:57:52
he's not a god he's a spirit another way of saying this might be if we were to put in a more modern language
1:57:58
eros is a force or heiress is a will
1:58:04
through this redefining of what aeros is it allows socrates to speak of arrows of
1:58:09
the power of love in terms which are at once more abstract
1:58:15
but also more honest and more explicit error more straightforward
1:58:21
that's really the word i'm looking for so eris is defined as a relationship as something which exists as an
1:58:26
intercessor um between you know it could be between two beings the lover and the beloved between
1:58:33
mankind or but between god and man is the the example that that he just cited diatoma
1:58:39
using so era is the love of the beautiful it's a mediating force it's not a personified god that arose at
1:58:45
a particular time although to be fair socrates does give through diatoma an alternative set
1:58:52
or an uh sorry alternative um explanation uh mythological explanation for the the
1:58:59
origins of eros in their remarks immediately following this um
1:59:05
you know he says eros is the child of resource and poverty so in allegorical terms love is the
1:59:12
mediating force by which those with a great need find the resourcefulness to
1:59:17
seek after that need but this is all symbolic i mean immediately after this description
1:59:23
socrates goes on to reiterate that eros is neither mortal nor immortal but is a
1:59:28
thing that shoots into and out of life manifests here and there but neither
1:59:34
endures forever nor fades away forever so eris is beginning to look more and
1:59:40
more like this this uh well again by deep personifying eros right they've been speaking of aeros as
1:59:47
this universal force by de personifying him he can make eros this force that's part of all things
1:59:54
that's literally shoots into and out of all things that are alive
1:59:59
it's he would even say in modern uh in comparative philosophy right modern
2:00:06
comparative philosophy we might be able to look at eros as being similar to the dao the way in taoist philosophy
2:00:14
insofar as aeros is not a being or entity himself but a pattern a way that all things behave something that exists
2:00:22
within all of these phenomena not an independent phenomenon himself
2:00:30
or we could grab a comparison a bit closer at hand to greek philosophy we might consider the way that
2:00:35
heraclitus uses the term logos a natural pattern a rhythm that moves
2:00:41
through all things um but so
2:00:47
the reason why eros makes possible all the things that the other speakers at the symposium attributed to his influence
2:00:52
such as pursuing virtue or mastering an art or a craft is that eros is the thing between
2:00:59
ignorance and wisdom as socrates says or
2:01:04
rather as he relates to us that diatoma says the wise do not wish for wisdom because they already have it
2:01:10
but it's not as if the ignorant desire to have wisdom either because that's why they remain ignorant
2:01:16
it's not wisdom in and of itself that seeks after wisdom but ignorance in and of itself
2:01:23
doesn't seek after wisdom either so what is it it's eros
2:01:28
it's the relationship mediating between ignorance and wisdom
2:01:33
uh so diatoma then says quote
2:01:38
wisdom is one of the most beautiful things and eros is the love of beauty
2:01:44
so eros must necessarily be a lover of wisdom and a lover of wisdom he falls between
2:01:51
wisdom and ignorance end quote so um
2:01:57
once again this uh very interesting logical uh technique that we're using
2:02:04
to identify arrows as this mediating thing um but notice specifically what we're talking
2:02:10
about here a lover of wisdom is what filos love
2:02:16
sophia wisdom so socrates presents eros as not just a
2:02:22
spirit but a philosopher right and we might consider with the the term spirit too
2:02:28
you know psyche um the association of spirit with mind
2:02:33
with consciousness right um and so that is rather apropos for the
2:02:39
way socrates would describe what aeros is but we might say that he's kind of describing him almost as like the spirit
2:02:45
of philosophy here that wisdom is the most beautiful thing because wisdom's the thing that allows
2:02:51
us to understand what it is that's truly beautiful it's arguments like this one that i think lead people to suggest that
2:02:58
socrates might have just made diatoma up because this argument sounds very similar to the ones that socrates
2:03:04
likes to give oftentimes in his dialogue socrates's conclusions tend to be variations on the theme of
2:03:11
the philosopher's life as the most virtuous or if philosophy is the highest good
2:03:17
um you know of course our that's an affirmation of his own type of person and so that being said
2:03:26
again perhaps diatoma was real and maybe the reason why it's the kind of soccer uh kind of
2:03:31
argument that socrates likes to give is because maybe he was influenced by diana again it does
2:03:38
it really doesn't matter but um notice that socrates has at this point capitulated to many of the main
2:03:45
points that were rounded off by the speech of agathon he's refined the argument most completely by bringing it
2:03:51
into abstract and philosophical terms and out of the religious
2:03:56
which in itself i mean it undermines all the core themes of agathon speech but at the same time
2:04:02
in a dialectical maneuver it carries forward the same concerns of the previous speeches of what love is
2:04:10
um and the way they've gone about this defining love's impact on human lives
2:04:16
and then love's effect on all nature and then the inner character of love socrates then takes it further
2:04:22
to where our perspective as to what we're talking about when we're talking about the nature of love is that we're talking about an
2:04:28
intermediating force not a god we're talking about a relationship of attraction
2:04:33
um and so that tells us that the inner character of love is ultimately
2:04:38
um if it is the love of the beautiful it it's the love of wisdom because wisdom is the most beautiful of all beautiful
2:04:45
things and the reason why is because it's only through wisdom that socrates is able to even understand all the
2:04:50
things that he's just explained to us about love right um
2:04:56
go back to nietzsche's 1864 essay i'm going to jump back actually before the
2:05:01
paragraph i read before to the very first paragraph nietzsche writes about the symposium which i think will be helpful here
2:05:07
because nietzsche states his underlying point immediately which means that nietzsche displays more
2:05:12
talent for brevity than i do quote to get to the point immediately
2:05:18
concerning how i think about the relationship between the first five speeches and socrates's speech
2:05:24
it seems to me the claim that plato has only brought together inadequate perspectives on eros in order to present
2:05:30
socrates's speech over and against them as the only correct one is completely an error
2:05:36
socrates himself does not deny these speeches their accolades he comes back to many things in them as he assigns
2:05:42
each single perspective its own due place much more i believe that from the first
2:05:47
speech to the last a decisive progress takes place insofar as each successive perspective increases
2:05:53
and and broadens the previous perspective and some essential aspect the individual speakers see the concept
2:06:00
of eros emerge with growing clarity until in the end socrates takes the cumulatively developed building and only
2:06:06
rounds it off with a dome he does not destroy it naturally this is valid only with
2:06:11
respect to the fundamental perspective of each speaker whatever was added as ornament to their developments
2:06:19
is rejected by socrates in many ways as unjustified end quote
2:06:24
and so that is just it what socrates rejects is the ornamentation the attempts of the speakers
2:06:31
to give as much appearance of praise for eros as they could remember the issue that socrates draws attention
2:06:37
to at the beginning of his speech and says he won't indulge in the obligation for the appearance of praise
2:06:44
therefore what socrates is doing is pulling the gems out of each speech the most beautiful parts which are to say
2:06:50
the insightful parts each or their wisdom you could say right
2:06:55
each speech contributes some central idea um which to socrates is the most
2:07:01
important thing um the poetic verses the mythical stories
2:07:07
loquacious exaltations all of this is not what socrates finds beautiful he's looking for the bits of
2:07:13
wisdom he can string together to produ produce this coherent rational account of what they're talking about
2:07:21
so one way that socrates addresses possessionism wisdom for example is in this section where diatoma argues quote
2:07:29
why don't we say that everyone is a lover if everyone always loves the same things
2:07:35
why do we call some people lovers and not others end quote and uh we'll skipping further
2:07:40
down in the passage quote what we're doing is picking out one kind of love and applying it to the name love that
2:07:46
belongs to the whole class while we use different names for other kinds of love
2:07:52
end quote so possianis was the first to raise the issue that there might be multiple types
2:07:58
of love confounded under a single label socrates then puts forward the idea here
2:08:06
that as eric semikus also argued eros is behind every type of craft every type of
2:08:12
human effort he specifically mentions musical composition [Music] but we don't call these people lovers
2:08:19
per se we don't tend to speak in the language of saying that what the composer or the mechanic is doing is
2:08:25
loving so further down diatoma continues quote eros is the whole desire of good things
2:08:32
and of being happy the greatest and all beguiling arrows
2:08:37
but those who turn toward it in many other ways in terms of either money making love of gymnastics or philosophy
2:08:44
are neither said to love nor called lovers whereas those who earnestly apply themselves to a single certain kind get
2:08:51
the name of the whole love and are said to love and are called lovers end quote
2:08:59
i should clarify she sort of means this as a criticism right of how how ignorant we are so we may notice that what's
2:09:04
beginning to take shape here could be compared to nietzsche's idea of one fundamental force
2:09:11
one fundamental will that motivates everything and that drives everything in human life
2:09:16
and within nature in nietzsche's formulation that's the will to power however
2:09:22
um you know arguably we've already had some concept of a fundamental force in the form of the universal law of attraction
2:09:29
or the love of the beautiful that's already appeared in the previous speeches but in the picture that socrates gives us in his speech
2:09:37
the key parallel between arrows is given by diatoma and the will to power that nietzsche would later coin is that both
2:09:43
are presented as a force that manifests itself in other ways
2:09:48
in the form of what we might call sublimations so just as nisha says our will to truth
2:09:53
to seek the truth um that's a sublimation of our will to power
2:10:00
diatoma argues that the love of the craftsman for his craft his desire
2:10:05
that's really a desire to attain wisdom to attain virtue in his craft and so on and so forth
2:10:11
again using virtue in the greek sense of the word which we talked about last week this is also that's a sublimation it's driven by
2:10:19
the same mediating force of eros or the love of the beautiful which means of course
2:10:25
inherently the love of what is good what is why is what is virtuous so the craftsman you know doing his
2:10:33
woodworking is actually a lover it's just we don't we don't recognize
2:10:39
that we don't see that so diatoma continues quote
2:10:45
there is a certain account according to which those who seek their own halves are lovers
2:10:50
but my speech denies that eros is of a half or of a whole unless that half or
2:10:56
whole can be presumed to be really good for human beings are willing to have their own feet and hands cut off
2:11:03
if they think that those parts of themselves are diseased end quote
2:11:09
and again that's obviously an answer to a previous speech in this case aristophanes
2:11:16
but again in concrete terms the premise of that speech is denied
2:11:22
that arrow says this intermediating force leads men from ignorance to wisdom and from ugliness to beauty and from
2:11:27
wickedness to virtue um it can't be
2:11:33
understood in this way that the desire to bond with another human being
2:11:38
cannot be explained as simply the desire to restore an original unity socrates
2:11:44
redefines the desire to forge these bonds as the desire to bring forth something
2:11:50
good to say that we are just the other halves of one another's bodies doesn't mean on
2:11:55
the face of it that we would necessarily want to become whole with those other halves if the union wouldn't produce
2:12:01
something good if it wouldn't produce something of value here meaning would not help us in our seeking after the
2:12:06
beautiful and the evidence that he uses that we would we would even cut off our own limbs if they became quote bad right
2:12:14
or diseased is the way this translation has it but really another creation translation it just says if we we would
2:12:20
cut our own hands and feed our off if we were to think that those parts were bad um
2:12:27
you know we might consider the example of cutting off a gangrenous limb just something that physicians often found to be
2:12:34
necessary in past times so the idea is that wholeness in and of
2:12:39
itself is not good just because it's wholeness that occasionally you may need to cleave
2:12:45
off a part of the whole for the good of the whole so the motivating force in people coming
2:12:51
together and having romantic love and producing children
2:12:56
must be understood as purely this instinct this drive towards the good
2:13:01
it's not simply a desire to create wholeness because wholeness is not in and of
2:13:07
itself good a key aspect of this insight is that love is redefined from something
2:13:14
which is about restoring what was lost right which may be like an unintended
2:13:19
consequence an a view that that you would be maybe inclined to hold as a result
2:13:26
of um agathon's speech but now
2:13:31
we're looking at love as something different now it's about generating something new
2:13:37
so diatoma goes on to describe sexual relations and the birth of children as a divine thing and this
2:13:44
divine process is how human beings in uh attain immortality
2:13:50
how they attain to what is eternal so diatoma then addresses the speech all
2:13:55
the way back at the beginning speech of phaedrus who focused on the willingness of lovers to die for the ones they love
2:14:03
and so of course we have now expanded this observation to include all of nature
2:14:08
and we've now refined what this eros is and what we are going to say is responsible for this
2:14:14
willingness to give up one's life so diatoma says and i'm quoting here in an abridged form quote
2:14:21
what do you believe is the cause of this eros and desire or aren't you aware how uncanny
2:14:27
is the disposition of all the beasts whenever they desire to produce offspring
2:14:33
they are all ill and of a neurotic disposition first concerning actual intercourse with
2:14:38
one another then later concerning the nurture of what is generated and they are ready to fight to the
2:14:44
finish the weakest against the strongest for the sake of those they have generated
2:14:50
and to die on their behalf and they are willingly racked by starvation and stop at nothing to nourish their
2:14:57
offspring one might suppose that human beings do this from calculation
2:15:03
but as for the beasts what is the cause of their erotic disposition being of this sort end quote
2:15:11
so again there's a refusal to reduce this divine eros to anything resembling an instinct
2:15:17
for preserving or restoring right eros is about generating what we have
2:15:24
here is perhaps another parallel then to nietzsche's world to power idea that eros is the power within all life that
2:15:30
seeks after the good and here we have it clearly explained that what's good for life is not always to
2:15:36
preserve itself just as one doesn't wish to simply preserve a limb that is diseased and will kill the whole
2:15:43
or in the way a mother or father whether human or animal will die to protect their children like their offspring um
2:15:50
eros has an element that is self-overcoming and self-transformative and about generating it's not simply
2:15:56
aimed at the continuation of life as it is but in bringing forth the good bringing forth wisdom
2:16:05
the ottoman elaborates further and as her explanation continues these characteristics of eros when considered
2:16:10
altogether altogether excuse me give way to the understanding of what eros is
2:16:16
but it truly is we seek after the beautiful why because the beautiful is good well yes
2:16:24
but on a deeper level you know why is it good what it's because within the beautiful we
2:16:29
create the good right we we give rise to the good but what what is this what is this good that
2:16:35
everyone seeks after and the answer the key to all of this is immortality as we've hinted at and so
2:16:41
diatoma then explains and again i
2:16:46
have abridged this quote in a couple places quote in the heiress of the beasts
2:16:53
in terms of the same argument as that concerning men the mortal nature seeks as far as
2:16:58
possible to be forever and immortal mortal nature is capable of immortality
2:17:04
only in this way the way of generation because it is always leaving behind
2:17:09
another that is young to replace the old for while each one of the animals is said to live and be the same
2:17:16
for example one is spoken of as the same from the time one is a child until one is an old man though he never has the
2:17:23
same things in himself nevertheless he is called the same he is forever becoming young in some respects
2:17:30
as he suffers losses in other respects his hair flesh bones blood and his whole
2:17:37
body this is so not only in terms of the body but also in terms of the soul
2:17:43
his ways character opinions desires pleasures pains fears
2:17:50
each of these things is never present as the same for each but they are partly coming to be and
2:17:56
partly perishing and what is far stranger still is that in the case of our sciences too
2:18:02
not only are some coming to be while others are perishing for studying as it is called is done on
2:18:08
the grounds that the science is passing out from us for forgetfulness is the exiting of
2:18:14
science and studying by instilling a fresh memory again to replace the departing one preserves the science
2:18:21
for in this way every mortal thing is preserved not by being absolutely the same forever as the divine is
2:18:29
but by the fact that that which is departing and growing old leaves behind another young thing that is as it was
2:18:37
by this device the mortal shares in immortality both body and all the rest
2:18:44
but the immortal has a different way so do not be amazed if everything honors by nature its own offshoot
2:18:51
for it is for the sake of immortality that this zeal and eros attain
2:18:56
everything end quote sorry attend everything i screwed up the
2:19:02
end of the quote um but whatever you get the gist so so so much in this passage is i think
2:19:09
incredibly important what diatomic describes as the fundamental change of eros is the strive
2:19:14
to seek after immortality or what we might call a will to eternity or will to eternalize
2:19:21
it's undoubtedly an influence on nietzsche insofar as nietzsche would later express and thus book zarathustra that all who
2:19:28
say yes to life and its joys want deep profound eternity of all things the ultimate affirmation of life the
2:19:34
ultimate good of life is to will for it to go on forever
2:19:39
but diana is not talking just about what we wish she's talking about how the way things
2:19:45
actually are light and so how are things actually well life doesn't go on by being absolutely the same forever as the
2:19:52
gods do life is always changing it's this endless dynamic flux i mean this is all
2:19:57
this stuff about the body and that passage and how we have to continually preserve
2:20:02
knowledge by um i mean so that's all very the stuff about forgetfulness is very
2:20:08
important to uh you know in comparison to the things nietzsche later wrote about
2:20:13
forgetfulness about how forgetfulness is this active force right and uh
2:20:20
so without this constant renewing without this constant uh bringing to mind the way diana puts it
2:20:27
instilling a fresh memory again to replace the departing one all of our knowledge departs
2:20:33
um and so knowledge sort of has to quote unquote reproduce in this same way
2:20:39
and so keep that in mind because we'll come back to that but again with even even the body even
2:20:45
within the span of single life and a single individual your body is not the same the whole time
2:20:51
i mean what is it like seven years all of your dna has like completely changed or every cell in your
2:20:57
body has regenerated i forget what it is i'm sure you're all familiar with the ship of theseus um
2:21:03
parable the idea of a ship that's had every single part of it replaced but slowly
2:21:08
you know you know one board is pulled up and replaced every single year until however
2:21:14
many years later it's completely different ship that's the case even with our own bodies
2:21:19
um and it's certainly the case with the the human race right um
2:21:24
that we people don't live forever but the human race is still here it's been
2:21:29
here for millions of years and so um you know maybe a million or a
2:21:36
hundred thousand in our current form i forget exactly what the number might be but um
2:21:43
yeah we replace ourselves every you know generation
2:21:49
and so this is how mortals strive after immortality
2:21:54
and eros is that same mediating force that it's allowing mankind to pursue what is eternal even as we're subject
2:22:02
to arising and passing away that's how we pursue wisdom even though we're always forgetting
2:22:08
and our knowledge is always fleeing from our minds the bridge between the mortal and the immortal between ignorance and wisdom between
2:22:15
ugliness and the beautiful that is the ultimate good that wise people see in arrows the drive from what was
2:22:23
incomplete or faulty to that which is perfect
2:22:28
the great drive in mankind to seek after the eternal even as we partake in these temporary
2:22:34
mortal lives and so diatoma concludes and she recapitulates here to pascianus that
2:22:41
there are multiple ways of mortals creating the good or bringing forth the good and while this applies to having
2:22:46
children it also applies to what we might call pregnancy of the spirit or of being pregnant with wisdom and insight
2:22:53
because remember wisdom is the most beautiful thing and that's because it gives rise to the
2:22:58
greatest good um and if the good we're all seeking his immortality
2:23:04
wisdom gives rise to the greatest approximation of immortality creations of the mind
2:23:11
are another form of offspring different from children but we might say that the offspring of
2:23:16
the mind can remain quote unquote alive so to speak for centuries or millennia unlike flesh
2:23:23
and blood so diatoma describes us someone like a wise mentor that you know possianis
2:23:30
talked about this it could be like a partner that could help birth someone else's wisdom into the
2:23:35
world and so again we have the idea of eros in the physical sense as a common form of
2:23:41
eros which is aimed at giving rise to offspring you know seeking physical beauty giving physical birth
2:23:47
you know uh creating goodness in the physical sense um and this is remember that's what
2:23:53
socrates kind of starts out saying that it's about the love of the beautiful brings forth the good we we go
2:23:59
it's by joining of the with the beautiful or some something like that um
2:24:04
i mean you can you can think about that in a very simple straightforward course
2:24:09
you might say vulgar remember vulgar the old meaning means common we could think about it in those terms
2:24:16
what does it mean to say you generate the good within the beautiful it means you find a beautiful partner the most
2:24:22
beautiful one you can manage and together you generate offspring with
2:24:27
that person right and that's what's good because that is the human attempt at
2:24:33
immortality but then there's this higher divine eros which is
2:24:39
not for everyone to experience but for a great few really
2:24:44
and they give birth to beauty that's immaterial and because it's immaterial
2:24:50
it partakes even more purely of the eternal and so it's the same distinction that passionate makes but we're now at a
2:24:57
much higher level of understanding not just thinking about in terms of of
2:25:03
the god the two erote as literal gods right diatoma argues in conclusion that the
2:25:09
ultimate aim of eros is the attainment of beauty itself not beauty is contained within one
2:25:16
particular form or another um or i shouldn't use the word form because
2:25:21
she's really talking about beauty in terms of the theory of the forms so you might say the
2:25:27
idea idea of beauty so every manifestation of beauty which we
2:25:33
perceive is just about a glimpse of the true nature of beauty itself
2:25:38
every individual beautiful phenomenon is a mere approximation which means that true beauty is in some sense
2:25:45
beauty and the abstract which is the exact sense in which we're now talking about it which is only possible
2:25:51
if one has been instructed in the ways of philosophy has learned to separate the idea of the beautiful in and of
2:25:57
itself to separate that from the individual beautiful phenomena and consider what
2:26:02
beauty is that is not contained in specific manifestations to speak of what is the beautiful
2:26:09
and in the inside of diatoma we might say or you know that's wisdom
2:26:15
that that can only be arrived at by the union of two minds just with as with physical
2:26:21
reproduction too that you need instruction in the ways of virtue and learning so that one can give
2:26:26
birth to things within the world of ideas you know not not subject to the same
2:26:33
fleetiness as the world of nature and so diatoma uh says quote
2:26:40
this is the right method of approaching the ways of love or being led by someone else
2:26:45
beginning from these beautiful things always to go up with the aim of reaching that beauty
2:26:52
like someone using a staircase you should go from one to two and from two to all beautiful bodies and from
2:26:59
beautiful bodies to beautiful practices and from practices to beautiful forms of learning
2:27:05
from forms of learning he should end up at that form of learning which is of nothing other than that of beauty itself
2:27:11
so he can complete the process of learning what beauty really is in that form of life my dear socrates if in any
2:27:19
human life should be lived gazing on beauty itself if you ever saw that it would seem to be
2:27:26
on a different level from gold and clothes and beautiful boys and young men
2:27:31
don't you realize that it's only in that kind of life when someone sees beauty with the part that can see it that he'll
2:27:37
be able to give birth not just to images of virtue since it's not images that he's in touch
2:27:42
with but to true virtue since it's true beauty that he's in touch with
2:27:49
it's someone who's given birth to true virtue and brought it up who has the chance of becoming loved by
2:27:55
the gods and immortal if any human being can be immortal
2:28:01
inclu end quote so that concludes diatoma's speech and
2:28:06
by that token socrates's speech socrates says that all of these things he learned from diatoma led him to
2:28:13
understand that every man should hold a respect for eros and that he himself practices the ways
2:28:18
of love with great care and in response to this aristodemos says
2:28:24
there were words of congratulation for socrates and uh as soon as socrates is finished
2:28:30
speaking uh and before aristophanes chimes in because he wishes to quarrel with socrates in some point or another
2:28:37
suddenly alcibiades appears in the scene now
2:28:43
alcibiades is outside and he's drunk shouting for agathon
2:28:49
agathon orders his slaves to go see who it is and uh you know when they bring alcibiades
2:28:55
inside he has to support himself with the help of the flute girl and a few other standing around him
2:29:00
because he's stumbling and staggering about uh quote he stood by the door wearing a
2:29:06
thick garland of ivy and violets with masses of ribbons trailing over his head and said
2:29:12
good evening gentlemen will you let someone who's drunk very drunk join your symposium end quote
2:29:21
i mentioned in the last part alcibiades is a very important historical figure
2:29:27
he was a general who fought for multiple different nation states during the peloponnesian war
2:29:33
now eventually his historically he was exiled but this is the symposium is during the time
2:29:39
when alcibiades he would have been regarded as a great man he's a statesman an orator a military
2:29:45
man in many respects he's the exact opposite type of person from somebody like socrates
2:29:51
you know socrates was a plebeian and by all accounts an ugly person his life and his craft is entirely
2:29:58
intellectual socrates is the theoretical man
2:30:04
alcibiades on the other hand is a non-theoretical man he um that's the distinction that nietzsche draws in his
2:30:10
first book birth of tragedy uh which he would write um
2:30:15
eight years after the 1864 essay where he discusses different types of
2:30:20
theoretical men he you know he designates socrates as the alpha the sort of the original
2:30:26
theoretical type but at the end of that passage he lists napoleon as an example of a non-theorist as he
2:30:33
calls him he also would invoke goethe who spoke of the productivity of deeds
2:30:39
in contrast to productivity when it comes to writing plays and poems and intellectual productions and so on and
2:30:45
so forth and so alcibiades is not the kind of man who leaves behind edifices of the mind
2:30:51
like a philosopher he's the man who does great deeds who acts in the world such as by commanding troops leading the
2:30:57
state and so on um and he i mean it's just it's very difficult to
2:31:04
describe i mean alcibiades would have been so respected and admired and known and
2:31:10
famous by everybody in greek society right and yet what happens next at the
2:31:16
symposium is quite unexpected if we consider all these things because upon seeing socrates
2:31:21
alcibiades immediately leaps up and began becomes like ranting and raving because also biotes it turns out
2:31:28
is madly in love with socrates and this applies not just to the mind of socrates but to physical love for him as
2:31:35
well alcibiades immediately begins just waxing poetic
2:31:40
about his unrequited infatuation with socrates and when he finds out that all
2:31:46
of the men there have been making speeches about love he declares he will make such a speech
2:31:51
also but rather than praising eros alcibiades says that he's going to make a speech
2:31:57
praising socrates alcibiades tells us of how he became
2:32:02
smitted with socrates he says if he wasn't drunk he might not speak so freely on the matter but
2:32:08
he confesses his feelings to all present because he is drunk you know following this attraction that
2:32:13
he felt to socrates he naturally tried to possess him but found that he couldn't do it twice
2:32:19
he recounts in the story he invited socrates to his home for dinner and you know he's planning on making an
2:32:25
advance on him afterwards and the first time socrates just leaves him immediately as soon as the dinner is
2:32:30
finished the second time he manages to get socrates to stay and spend the night
2:32:35
with him uh or you know he offers him he's like oh it's late it's dan you know you shouldn't walk home now you can spend
2:32:40
the night at my house and he then makes another advance and socrates of course resists him again
2:32:46
um and uh thwarts him you know he's thwarts his attempts to sleep with him
2:32:52
and uh since socrates shows himself to be unable to be possessed by
2:32:59
alcibiades it only makes alcibiades want socrates even more
2:33:04
and the more socrates flees from his advances the more it makes this great man this statesman this man
2:33:10
of action feel inferior to or feel like a slave
2:33:16
to this man this this this wise man of no material status or ambition
2:33:23
this philosopher and so socrates becomes all the more attractive to alcibiades all the more
2:33:29
mysterious and then uh as he goes on the speech he also talks about the virtues of socrates
2:33:35
how when socrates was part of a military campaign at patadea he bore the privations of warfare better
2:33:41
than anyone else he showed an endurance and a strength of character that was unmatched
2:33:46
all these experiences with socrates showed him a man who was superior to everyone else around him
2:33:52
if not in terms of physical beauty but in terms of virtue and so socrates even though he's
2:33:58
physically ugly is so beautiful in the sense of his wisdom and his virtue that
2:34:04
you know alcibiades who is himself physically beautiful and who is this man of action who lives in the physical
2:34:10
world he finds himself entranced by socrates and he can't understand why and
2:34:16
he concludes with the sentiment that there's no other human being like socrates throughout the past or the present
2:34:23
and his speech after all the profound discussion beforehand is met with mostly laughter
2:34:29
now the decision to follow up socrates's seeming finale to the discussion with a
2:34:34
drunken love letter of alcibiades seems to be a strange artistic decision and i often wondered
2:34:42
what exactly was going on here at this part in the story whenever i'd read symposium in the past
2:34:47
um you know after the speech of socrates alcibiades doesn't really seem to introduce any new ideas it just kind of
2:34:53
derails everything into a bunch of praise for socrates um
2:34:59
and so you know that would seem to if you're going off of the standard view
2:35:05
of what plato is doing in the symposium you know that's the he intends to like
2:35:11
basically present all of these inferior speeches and then socrates comes in and uh
2:35:18
you know destroys all of all the other speakers with facts and logic and then it maybe would make sense if it was like
2:35:23
oh and then we'll just have a if if you think this is just like platonist propaganda for why socrates is so great
2:35:29
right if that's the depth of your interpretation of the story i guess it kind of makes sense that then you would just write a part where
2:35:36
you know the greatest man in athens comes in and talks about how much he loves socrates
2:35:41
but it was actually reading nietzsche's interpretation in his essay that unlocked a new understanding for me
2:35:48
of why the dialogue ends the way it does in nietzsche's interpretation the reason
2:35:54
for alcibiades appearing just as soon as socrates's speech is done is that alcibiades through his actions
2:36:01
proves the case that socrates just made socrates outlines a view of eros that as
2:36:06
we said makes arrows out to be a spirit of philosophy
2:36:11
seeking out of the beautiful in order to give rise to the good and the most beautiful thing is wisdom
2:36:17
because you know wisdom gives rise to the ultimate good the good which is most immortal which is you know immortalities
2:36:23
of the highest value for us mortal human beings and so that ultimate good is synonymous with virtue the thing that
2:36:29
improves and perfects us that's like the effect of arrows that everyone's been talking about and the wisdom that governs virtue and
2:36:35
gives us an understanding of virtue is immortal and that because it's a thing that doesn't die with any one person
2:36:43
and so socrates has given us that argument but socrates is just a figure
2:36:50
he's just such a figure that is described in the speeches of socrates right who lives by eros he's a
2:36:56
philosopher who seeks the truth in order to give rise to the good
2:37:01
and indeed socrates's wisdom does live on through eternity he truly did give birth to philosophical
2:37:08
offspring right that have outlived the span of any individual human life
2:37:14
but in spite of that beautiful case that socrates argues we've yet to prove the case
2:37:19
that this is the nature of what love actually is i mean socrates appeals to ethos
2:37:24
um but do we believe him is diadem a real is this really a workable definition of love
2:37:31
but then alcibiades a beautiful powerful man through his drunkenly honest confession
2:37:38
of physical love for socrates for the object of his desire which is an
2:37:44
ugly lower class but philosophical man proves that socrates manifests the
2:37:51
arrows socrates through his wisdom becomes the most beautiful his
2:37:56
intellectual beauty trumps everything else and actually holds physical beauty in its thrall
2:38:02
in the way alcibiades feels himself to be a slave to his love for socrates
2:38:09
so nietzsche in his essay gives an account of the whole progression of the symposium and the
2:38:14
central role that the alcibiades speech plays in it and so this is a big long chunk from the
2:38:20
middle of the essay but in a sense it's the reason why we've spent two episodes talking about it is
2:38:27
to just look at this so that now we can talk about what nietzsche um had to say
2:38:33
so quote phaedrus is as elsewhere
2:38:39
only the midwife of the successive speeches but pausianus in whose speech one should
2:38:45
never let his love for agathon out of one's sight shows the human standpoint
2:38:50
as long as one loves something beautiful be it something corporeal or spiritual
2:38:56
eric symachus is the lover of everything beautiful as it reveals itself in the whole of nature
2:39:02
aristophanes stands already on the higher rung of the love of art and science just as agathon does
2:39:09
who it appears to me receives his higher place from plato by being a tragic poet
2:39:15
a judgment which we would no longer agree with the spiritually greater person by far is
2:39:20
aristophanes finally socrates himself reaches the
2:39:25
rung that diatoma designates as the highest love of the beautiful itself
2:39:31
we do not doubt that he has reached it but socrates himself does not say this to us and it may not fit with his
2:39:38
character indeed socrates describes how he was once caught in the same era as akkathon
2:39:44
is until he acquired this great insight the reader of the dialogue must remain uncertain of the degree to which this
2:39:51
love of the beautiful itself has been carried over into socrates's everyday life
2:39:57
at this point alcibiades appears in order to portray the effect of the love of the beautiful itself on human
2:40:03
practical life his appearance presents this love of the beautiful itself discussed by socrates
2:40:10
at work in an individual and also presents the reciprocal effect that the love-filled person alcibiades has on
2:40:17
others which mirrors the effect that socrates has on alcibiades
2:40:23
here is the reason then why pluto chooses alcibiades in order to describe these effects
2:40:29
if some other one of socrates's youths had appeared in order to glorify socrates the effect would be incomparably weaker
2:40:37
alcibiades compared to socrates is a complete apostate he is the young man entirely alienated
2:40:44
from philosophy socrates is influence in such a person on as it were such a brilliant person is
2:40:50
the most wonderful effect that plato could have given as a proof of the aforementioned reciprocal effect
2:40:57
so then alcibiades knows nothing of the past speeches to the surprise of the listeners he
2:41:02
traces the practical side of the person under the influence of the beautiful itself
2:41:08
while socrates traces the theoretical side plato presents alcibiades as drunk to
2:41:14
allow him to express himself more freely about things things that must be avoided in serious measured conversation
2:41:21
mentioning them was necessary for they were historical facts thus the opposition between socrates of
2:41:26
speech and alcibiades's speech is noteworthy like the opposition of their two natures
2:41:33
because both express their deepest feelings the one through the mouth of a divinely inspired prophetess
2:41:40
the other under the inspiration of wine their deepest feelings which are the
2:41:45
same are for the beautiful itself one through the idea the other pointing toward actuality
2:41:52
socrates is the lover of the beautiful itself but alcibiades is also a lover of the
2:41:58
beautiful itself at the same time what a difference there is in their natures the one is as
2:42:04
ethically sublime as the other is ethically fallen the one as physically other ugly as the other is physically
2:42:11
beautiful the one as sober and self-controlled as the other drunk and
2:42:16
excited it is clear that these points apply as much to the philosophy as to the
2:42:21
artistic form of the dialogue at this point we should notice that a shift in tone occurs with alcibiades's
2:42:27
entrance it shows the most daring artistic grasp that in the moment when socrates has led his listeners to the highest ocean of
2:42:34
the beautiful the reef of drunkenness and enthusiasm bursts upon them and indeed does not negate the effect of
2:42:41
socrates's speech but heightens it alcibiades's speech is the work of eros
2:42:46
just as socrates's speech is but alcibiades speech works through facts and socrates of speech works
2:42:54
through ideas and the facts work more powerfully and persuasively than the expressed ideas end quote
2:43:02
so alcibiades of speech to nietzsche's mind is anything but superfluous it's a master stroke of the dialogue the
2:43:09
demonstration in action as to what has only been outlined in terms of abstraction
2:43:17
nietzsche goes on to say that it's through this speech of all civilities that plato binds together all the
2:43:22
various speeches in the same way zeus tied together the human beings in their skins twisted off you know
2:43:30
twisted off the umbilical cord in a knot right by considering the two speeches side by
2:43:36
side the theoretical speech of socrates versus the impassioned speech of alcibiades we perceive the double
2:43:42
nature of eros the thing between the mortal world and the immortal world between spirit and
2:43:49
sensual between god and human beings we see the beautiful itself that socrates
2:43:54
just described in the person of socrates right the way alcibiades sees them we
2:44:00
catch a glimpse of the beautiful as he suggests we see the lover we see the person seeking after the beautiful in
2:44:06
alcibiades socrates just described eros as a spirit of philosophy and then here
2:44:13
the object of alcibiades is love is socrates the
2:44:18
quintessential philosopher and so that's it most of our questions are now answered
2:44:25
we have the answers as to what the power of love is we have a demonstration and the figure of socrates
2:44:31
and we have here in the modern age we have nietzsche's interpretation of the entire dialogue
2:44:38
and as for the lasting influence of this work on nietzsche's ideas i've touched on it briefly throughout but it seems to
2:44:45
me that we see a lasting influence in the idea of eros as a force that acts on all life
2:44:51
but which is sublimated in various ways and that how that relates to will to power we could also see
2:44:57
you know maybe in the idea that to love life is to seek the eternity of life and how that relates to
2:45:04
the amor fatih idea and the great challenge of eternal return
2:45:09
um i might even go so far to say that if indeed diatoma of mantanea is a real
2:45:14
person whose words we have through socrates we might well conclude she's probably the single most influential woman on the
2:45:21
thought of nietzsche because her description of a mediating force driving all life which is not
2:45:27
self-preservative but aimed itself overcoming and ultimately wishing at the bottom of
2:45:32
it all for eternity seems to me to be an articulation in rough terms for many of the same things
2:45:38
nietzsche would write about will to power and about um becoming trying to
2:45:44
transform itself into being because remember from the note we whenever in part one of our episodes on
2:45:49
an eternal return the most sublime form of will to power is to transform becoming into being to try and pull
2:45:56
a phenomenon from the endless transformative flux from the chaos of existence and give it duration
2:46:03
it's the impossible dream that's our deepest hope the beautiful illusion that our world to power is always aiming at and we have
2:46:10
the same idea right here in the symposium uh thousands of years before nietzsche
2:46:15
was born but perhaps this is not where we should linger for our final thought because as
2:46:21
we know socrates would uh take on a more central importance for nietzsche figure he would
2:46:27
often criticize or attack once he got a hold of what he called the problem of science right
2:46:33
so we have to remember though that socrates at this point in his career he's still a figure of admiration
2:46:38
for nietzsche and then there was in fact always an element of admiration in nietzsche's criticism of socrates
2:46:46
because nietzsche recognized that he himself occupied a similar philosophical archetype even when he recognized the
2:46:53
problems inherent with this type i've quoted this before but
2:46:58
oner pays a teacher badly if he remains a student only and so nietzsche of course has to break with socrates and
2:47:04
turn his power of critique against him eventually and so we should understand these
2:47:09
attacks as nietzsche overcoming his own mentor but it's in the symposium as i said in
2:47:14
the first episode that we see what it is that nietzsche originally saw in socrates and i don't think you can truly
2:47:21
comprehend all those criticisms that nietzsche makes of socrates until you glimpse the same
2:47:27
beautiful aspect of socrates that nisha did and we have to see why it is that nietzsche
2:47:33
found socrates so lovable and in my opinion socrates is lovable right
2:47:39
up until the end of the story and so here's how the story ends um
2:47:45
at the end you know he shows himself to possess that endurance and discipline of
2:47:50
character that also bites praised him for after all sobrieties gives his drunken speech
2:47:56
all the participants start falling one by one into drunkenness and sleep and a few others uh
2:48:02
you know stay up throughout the night talking and arguing um
2:48:08
even the narrator or well the second hand narrator right who told apple and doris the story aristodemus the guy who
2:48:15
was actually there even he begins to nod off and so uh we'll close with this final paragraph
2:48:21
recounting the end of the symposium quote
2:48:27
aristodemus said that eric simakis phaedrus and the others went away he himself fell asleep
2:48:34
and as the knights were long took a good rest he was awakened towards daybreak by a
2:48:40
crowing of and when he awoke the others were either asleep or had gone away
2:48:46
there remained only socrates aristophanes and agathon who were
2:48:51
drinking out of a large goblet which they passed around and socrates was discoursing to them
2:48:57
aristodemus was only half awake and he did not hear the beginning of the discourse the chief thing which he remembered was
2:49:04
socrates compelling the other two to acknowledge that the genius of comedy was the same with that of tragedy and
2:49:11
that the true artist and tragedy was an artist in comedy also to to this they were constrained to
2:49:18
ascent being drowsy and not quite following the argument and first of all aristophanes dropped
2:49:24
off then when the day was already dawning agathon
2:49:30
socrates having laid them to sleep rose to depart
2:49:35
aristodemus as was his manner followed him at the lycium socrates took a bath
2:49:42
and passed the day as usual in the evening he retired
2:49:48
and rested at his own home end quote
