<h1>
<span>Translator's Introduction.</span></h1>
<p>The publication of
        <span><span>Human,
        all-too-Human</span></span> extends over the period 1878-1880. Of the
        two divisions which constitute the Second Part, <span>“Miscellaneous Maxims and Opinions”</span> appeared in
        1879, and <span>“The Wanderer and his
        Shadow”</span> in 1880, Nietzsche being then in his thirty-sixth
        year. The Preface was added in 1886. The whole book forms Nietzsche's
        first lengthy contribution to literature. His previous works comprise
        only the philological treatises, <span><span>The Birth of
        Tragedy</span></span>, and the essays on Strauss, Schopenhauer, and
        Wagner in <span><span>Thoughts out of Season</span></span>.</p>
<p>With the volumes
        of <span>Human,
        all-too-Human</span> Nietzsche appears for the first time in
        his true colours as philosopher. His purely scholarly publications,
        his essays in literary and musical criticism—especially the essay on
        Richard Wagner at Bayreuth—had, of course, foreshadowed his work as a
        thinker.</p>
<p>These efforts,
        however, had been mere fragments, from which hardly any one could
        observe that a new philosophical star had arisen on the horizon. But
        by 1878 the period of transition had definitely set in. Outwardly,
        the new departure is marked by Nietzsche's resignation in that year
        of his professorship <span">[pg
        viii]</span><a></a>
        at Bâle—a resignation due partly to ill-health, and partly to his
        conviction that his was a voice that should speak not merely to
        students of philology, but to all mankind.</p>
<p>Nietzsche himself
        characterises <span>Human, all-too-Human</span> as
        <span>“the monument of a crisis.”</span> He might
        as fitly have called it the first-fruits of a new harvest. Now, for
        the first time, he practises the form which he was to make so
        peculiarly his own. We are told—and we may well believe—that the book
        came as a surprise even to his most intimate friends. Wagner had
        already seen how matters stood at the publication of the first part,
        and the gulf between the two probably widened on the appearance of
        the Second Part.</p>
<p>Several aphorisms
        are here, varying in length as in subject, and ranging over the whole
        human province—the emotions and aspirations, the religions and
        cultures and philosophies, the arts and literatures and politics of
        mankind. Equally varied is the range of style, the incisive epigram
        and the passage of pure poetry jostling each other on the same page.
        In this curious power of alternating between cynicism and lyricism,
        Nietzsche appears as the prose counterpart of Heine.</p>
<p>One or two of the
        aphorisms are of peculiar interest to English readers. The essay (as
        it may almost be called) on Sterne (p. <a>60</a>, No. 113) does ample justice, if not more than
        justice, to that wayward genius. The allusion to Milton (p. <a>77</a>, No. 150) will come as somewhat
        of a shock to English readers, especially to those who hold that in
        Milton Art triumphed over Puritanism. It <span>[pg ix]</span><a></a> should be remembered, however, that Nietzsche's
        view coincides with Goethe's. The dictum that Shakespeare's gold is
        to be valued for its quantity rather than its quality (p. <a>81</a>, No. 162) also betrays a certain
        exclusiveness—a legacy from that eighteenth-century France which
        appealed so strongly to Nietzsche on its intellectual side. To
        Nietzsche, as to Voltaire, Shakespeare is after all <span>“the great barbarian.”</span></p>
<p>The title of the
        book may be explained from a phrase in <span><span>Thus Spake
        Zarathustra</span></span>: <span>“Verily, even the
        greatest I found—all-too-human.”</span> The keynote of these volumes
        is indeed disillusion and destruction. Nor is this to be wondered at,
        for all men must sweep away the rubbish before they can build. Hence
        we find here little of the constructive philosophy of Nietzsche—so
        far as he had a constructive philosophy. The Superman appears but
        faintly, the doctrine of Eternal Recurrence not at all. For this very
        reason, <span><span>Human, all-too-Human</span></span> is perhaps
        the best starting-point for the study of Nietzsche. The difficulties
        in style and thought of the later work—difficulties that at times
        become well-nigh insuperable in <span><span>Thus Spake Zarathustra</span></span>—are here
        practically absent. The book may, in fact, almost be described as
        <span>“popular,”</span> bearing the same relation
        to Nietzsche's later productions as Wagner's <span><span>Tannhäuser</span></span> and <span><span>Lohengrin</span></span>
        bear to the <span><span>Ring</span></span>.</p>
<p>The translator's
        thanks are due to Mr. Thomas Common for his careful revision of the
        manuscript and many valuable suggestions.</p>

<h1>
<span>Preface.</span></h1>
<div>
<h2>
<span>1.</span></h2>
<p>One should only
          speak where one cannot remain silent, and only speak of what one
          has <em><span>conquered</span></em>—the rest is all chatter,
          <span>“literature,”</span> bad breeding. My
          writings speak only of my conquests, <span>“I”</span> am in them, with all that is hostile to me,
          <span><span>ego ipsissimus</span></span>, or, if a more
          haughty expression be permitted, <span><span>ego ipsissimum</span></span>. It may be
          guessed that I have many below me.... But first I always needed
          time, convalescence, distance, separation, before I felt the
          stirrings of a desire to flay, despoil, lay bare, <span>“represent”</span> (or whatever one likes to call it)
          for the additional knowledge of the world, something that I had
          lived through and outlived, something done or suffered. Hence all
          my writings,—with one exception, important, it is true,—must be
          <em><span>ante-dated</span></em>—they always tell of a
          <span>“behind-me.”</span> Some even, like the
          first three <span><span>Thoughts out of Season</span></span>, must be
          thrown back before the period of creation and experience of a
          previously published book (<span><span>The Birth of Tragedy</span></span> in the case
          cited, as any one with subtle powers of observation and comparison
          could not fail to perceive). That wrathful outburst against the
          Germanism, smugness, and raggedness of speech of old David Strauss,
          the <span>[pg 002]</span><a></a> contents of the
          first <span><span>Thought out of Season</span></span>, gave a
          vent to feelings that had inspired me long before, as a student, in
          the midst of German culture and cultured Philistinism (I claim the
          paternity of the now much used and misused phrase <span>“cultured Philistinism”</span>). What I said against
          the <span>“historical disease”</span> I said as
          one who had slowly and laboriously recovered from that disease, and
          who was not at all disposed to renounce <span>“history”</span> in the future because he had suffered
          from her in the past. When in the third <span><span>Thought out of
          Season</span></span> I gave expression to my reverence for my first
          and only teacher, the <em><span>great</span></em> Arthur Schopenhauer—I should
          now give it a far more personal and emphatic voice—I was for my
          part already in the throes of moral scepticism and dissolution,
          that is, as much concerned with the criticism as with the study of
          all pessimism down to the present day. I already did not believe in
          <span>“a blessed thing,”</span> as the people
          say, not even in Schopenhauer. It was at this very period that an
          unpublished essay of mine, <span>“On Truth and
          Falsehood in an Extra-Moral Sense,”</span> came into being. Even my
          ceremonial oration in honour of Richard Wagner, on the occasion of
          his triumphal celebration at Bayreuth in 1876—Bayreuth signifies
          the greatest triumph that an artist has ever won—a work that bears
          the strongest stamp of <span>“individuality,”</span> was in the background an act of
          homage and gratitude to a bit of the past in me, to the fairest but
          most perilous calm of my sea-voyage ... and as a matter of fact a
          severance and a farewell. (Was Richard Wagner mistaken on this
          point? I do not think so. So long as we still love, we do not paint
          such pictures, <span>[pg
          003]</span><a></a>
          we do not yet <span>“examine,”</span> we do not
          place ourselves so far away as is essential for one who
          <span>“examines.”</span> <span>“Examining needs at least a secret antagonism, that of
          an opposite point of view,”</span> it is said on page 46 of the
          above-named work itself, with an insidious, melancholy application
          that was perhaps understood by few.) The composure that gave me the
          <em><span>power</span></em> to speak after many
          intervening years of solitude and abstinence, first came with the
          book, <span><span>Human, All-too Human</span></span>, to which
          this second preface and apologia<a><span><span>1</span></span></a> is
          dedicated. As a book for <span>“free
          spirits”</span> it shows some trace of that almost cheerful and
          inquisitive coldness of the psychologist, who has <em><span>behind</span></em>
          him many painful things that he keeps <em><span>under</span></em>
          him, and moreover establishes them for himself and fixes them
          firmly as with a needle-point. Is it to be wondered at that at such
          sharp, ticklish work blood flows now and again, that indeed the
          psychologist has blood on his fingers and not <em><span>only</span></em> on
          his fingers?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>2.</span></h2>
<p>The <span><span>Miscellaneous Maxims
          and Opinions</span></span> were in the first place, like
          <span><span>The
          Wanderer and His Shadow</span></span>, published separately as
          continuations and appendices to the above-mentioned human, all-too
          human <span><span>Book for Free Spirits</span></span>: and at
          the same time, as a continuation and confirmation of an
          intellectual cure, consisting in a course of anti-romantic
          self-treatment, such as my instinct, which had always remained
          <span>[pg 004]</span><a></a> healthy, had itself
          discovered and prescribed against a temporary attack of the most
          dangerous form of romantics. After a convalescence of six years I
          may well be permitted to collect these same writings and publish
          them as a second volume of <span><span>Human, All-too Human</span></span>. Perhaps,
          if surveyed together, they will more clearly and effectively teach
          their lesson—a lesson of health that may be recommended as a
          <span><span>disciplina voluntatis</span></span> to the
          more intellectual natures of the rising generation. Here speaks a
          pessimist who has often leaped out of his skin but has always
          returned into it, thus, a pessimist with goodwill towards
          pessimism—at all events a romanticist no longer. And has not a
          pessimist, who possesses this serpentine knack of changing his
          skin, the right to read a lecture to our pessimists of to-day, who
          are one and all still in the toils of romanticism? Or at least to
          show them how it is—done?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>3.</span></h2>
<p>It was then, in
          fact, high time to bid farewell, and I soon received proof. Richard
          Wagner, who seemed all-conquering, but was in reality only a
          decayed and despairing romantic, suddenly collapsed, helpless and
          broken, before the Christian Cross.... Was there not a single
          German with eyes in his head and sympathy in his heart for this
          appalling spectacle? Was I the only one whom he caused—suffering?
          In any case, the unexpected event illumined for me in one lightning
          flash the place that I had abandoned, and also the horror that is
          felt by every one who is unconscious of a great danger until he has
          passed <span id="page005">[pg
          005]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg005"></a>
          through it. As I went forward alone, I shuddered, and not long
          afterwards I was ill, or rather more than ill—weary: weary from my
          ceaseless disappointment about all that remained to make us modern
          men enthusiastic, at the thought of the power, work, hope, youth,
          love, flung to all the winds: weary from disgust at the effeminacy
          and undisciplined rhapsody of this romanticism, at the whole tissue
          of idealistic lies and softening of conscience, which here again
          had won the day over one of the bravest of men: last, and not
          least, weary from the bitterness of an inexorable suspicion—that
          after this disappointment I was doomed to mistrust more thoroughly,
          to despise more thoroughly, to be alone more thoroughly than ever
          before. My task—whither had it flown? Did it not look now as if my
          task were retreating from me and as if I should for a long future
          period have no more right to it? What was I to do to endure this
          most terrible privation?—I began by entirely forbidding myself all
          romantic music, that ambiguous, pompous, stifling art, which robs
          the mind of its sternness and its joyousness and provides a fertile
          soil for every kind of vague yearning and spongy sensuality.
          <span>“Cave musicam”</span> is even to-day my
          advice to all who are enough of men to cling to purity in matters
          of the intellect. Such music enervates, softens, feminises, its
          <span>“eternal feminine”</span> draws
          us—<em><span>down</span></em>!<a><span><span>2</span></span></a> My
          first suspicion, my most immediate precaution, was directed against
          romantic music. If I hoped for anything at all from music, it
          <span><span>was in the</span></span> expectation of the coming of a musician bold, subtle, malignant,
          southern, healthy enough to take an immortal revenge upon that
          other music.</p>

<p>Lonely now and
          miserably self-distrustful, I took sides, not without resentment,
          <em><span>against</span></em> myself and <em><span>for</span></em>
          everything that hurt me and was hard to me. Thus I once more found
          the way to that courageous pessimism that is the antithesis of all
          romantic fraud, and, as it seems to me to-day, the way to
          <span>“myself,”</span> to my task. That hidden
          masterful Something, for which we long have no name until at last
          it shows itself as our task—that tyrant in us exacts a terrible
          price for every attempt that we make to escape him or give him the
          slip, for every premature act of self-constraint, for every
          reconciliation with those to whom we do not belong, for every
          activity, however reputable, which turns us aside from our main
          purpose, yes, even for every virtue that would fain protect us from
          the cruelty of our most individual responsibility. <span>“Disease”</span> is always the answer when we wish to
          have doubts of our rights to our own task, when we begin to make it
          easier for ourselves in any way. How strange and how terrible! It
          is our very alleviations for which we have to make the severest
          atonement! And if we want to return to health, we have no choice
          left—we must load ourselves <em><span>more heavily</span></em> than we were ever
          laden before.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>5.</span></h2>
<p>It was then that
          I learnt the hermitical habit of speech acquired only by the most silent and
          suffering. I spoke without witnesses, or rather indifferent to the
          presence of witnesses, so as not to suffer from silence, I spoke of
          various things that did not concern me in a style that gave the
          impression that they did. Then, too, I learnt the art of showing
          myself cheerful, objective, inquisitive in the presence of all that
          is healthy and evil—is this, in an invalid, as it seems to me, his
          <span>“good taste”</span>? Nevertheless, a more
          subtle eye and sympathy will not miss what perhaps gives a charm to
          these writings—the fact that here speaks one who has suffered and
          abstained in such a way as if he had never suffered or abstained.
          Here equipoise, composure, even gratitude towards life <em><span>shall</span></em>
          be maintained, here rules a stern, proud, ever vigilant, ever
          susceptible will, which has undertaken the task of defending life
          against pain and snapping off all conclusions that are wont to grow
          like poisonous fungi from pain, disappointment, satiety, isolation
          and other morasses. Perhaps this gives our pessimists a hint to
          self-examination? For it was then that I hit upon the aphorism,
          <span>“a sufferer has as yet no right to
          pessimism,”</span> and that I engaged in a tedious, patient
          campaign against the unscientific first principles of all romantic
          pessimism, which seeks to magnify and interpret individual,
          personal experiences into <span>“general
          judgments,”</span> universal condemnations—it was then, in short,
          that I sighted a new world. Optimism for the sake of restitution,
          in order at some time to have the right to become a pessimist—do
          you understand that? Just as a physician transfers his patient to
          totally strange surroundings, in order to displace him from his entire <span>“past,”</span> his troubles, friends, letters, duties,
          stupid mistakes and painful memories, and teaches him to stretch
          out hands and senses towards new nourishment, a new sun, a new
          future: so I, as physician and invalid in one, forced myself into
          an utterly different and untried zone of the soul, and particularly
          into an absorbing journey to a strange land, a strange atmosphere,
          into a curiosity for all that was strange. A long process of
          roaming, seeking, changing followed, a distaste for fixity of any
          kind—a dislike for clumsy affirmation and negation: and at the same
          time a dietary and discipline which aimed at making it as easy as
          possible for the soul to fly high, and above all constantly to fly
          away. In fact a minimum of life, an unfettering from all coarser
          forms of sensuality, an independence in the midst of all marks of
          outward disfavour, together with the pride in being able to live in
          the midst of all this disfavour: a little cynicism perhaps, a
          little of the <span>“tub of Diogenes,”</span> a
          good deal of whimsical happiness, whimsical gaiety, much calm,
          light, subtle folly, hidden enthusiasm—all this produced in the end
          a great spiritual strengthening, a growing joy and exuberance of
          health. Life itself rewards us for our tenacious will to life, for
          such a long war as I waged against the pessimistic weariness of
          life, even for every observant glance of our gratitude, glances
          that do not miss the smallest, most delicate, most fugitive
          gifts.... In the end we receive Life's great gifts, perhaps the
          greatest it can bestow—we regain <em><span>our</span></em>
          task.</p>

<p>Should my
          experience—the history of an illness and a convalescence, for it
          resulted in a convalescence—be only my personal experience? and
          merely just my <span>“Human,
          All-too-human”</span>? To-day I would fain believe the reverse, for
          I am becoming more and more confident that my books of travel were
          not penned for my sole benefit, as appeared for a time to be the
          case. May I, after six years of growing assurance, send them once
          more on a journey for an experiment?—May I commend them
          particularly to the ears and hearts of those who are afflicted with
          some sort of a <span>“past,”</span> and have
          enough intellect left to suffer even intellectually from their
          past? But above all would I commend them to you whose burden is
          heaviest, you choice spirits, most encompassed with perils, most
          intellectual, most courageous, who must be the <em><span>conscience</span></em> of the modern soul and
          as such be versed in its <em><span>science</span></em>:<a><span><span>3</span></span></a> in whom
          is concentrated all of disease, poison or danger that can exist
          to-day: whose lot decrees that you must be more sick than any
          individual because you are not <span>“mere
          individuals”</span>: whose consolation it is to know and, ah! to
          walk the path to a new health, a health of to-morrow and the day
          after: you men of destiny, triumphant, conquerors of time, the
          healthiest and the strongest, you <em><span>good

<p>To express
          finally in a single formula my opposition <span><span>010</span></span><a></a> to the romantic pessimism of the abstinent,
          the unfortunate, the conquered: there is a will to the tragic and
          to pessimism, which is a sign as much of the severity as of the
          strength of the intellect (taste, emotion, conscience). With this
          will in our hearts we do not fear, but we investigate ourselves the
          terrible and the problematical elements characteristic of all
          existence. Behind such a will stand courage and pride and the
          desire for a really great enemy. That was <em><span>my</span></em>
          pessimistic outlook from the first—a new outlook, methinks, an
          outlook that even at this day is new and strange? To this moment I
          hold to it firmly and (if it will be believed) not only <em><span>for</span></em>
          myself but occasionally <em><span>against</span></em> myself.... You would
          prefer to have that proved first? Well, what else does all this
          long preface—prove?</p>

<p><span><span>To the
          Disillusioned in Philosophy.</span></span>—If you hitherto believed
          in the highest value of life and now find yourselves disillusioned,
          must you immediately get rid of life at the lowest possible
          price?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>2.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Overnice.</span></span>—One can even
          become overnice as regards the clearness of concepts. How disgusted
          one is then at having truck with the half-clear, the hazy, the
          aspiring, the doubting! How ridiculous and yet not mirth-provoking
          is their eternal fluttering and straining without ever being able
          to fly or to grasp!</p>

<p><span><span>The Wooers of
          Reality.</span></span>—He who realises at last how long and how
          thoroughly he has been befooled, embraces out of spite even the
          ugliest reality. So that in the long run of the world's history the
          best men have always been wooers of reality, for the best have
          always been longest and most thoroughly deceived.</p>
</div><span><span>014</span></span><a></a>
<div>
<h2>
<span>4.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Advance of
          Freethinking.</span></span>—The difference between past and present
          freethinking cannot better be characterised than by that aphorism
          for the recognition and expression of which all the fearlessness of
          the eighteenth century was needed, and which even then, if measured
          by our modern view, sinks into an unconscious naïveté. I mean
          Voltaire's aphorism, <span>“croyez-moi, mon ami,
          l'erreur aussi a son mérite.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>5.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Hereditary
          Sin of Philosophers.</span></span>—Philosophers have at all times
          appropriated and <em><span>corrupted</span></em> the maxims of censors of
          men (moralists), by taking them over without qualification and
          trying to prove as necessary what the moralists only meant as a
          rough indication or as a truth suited to their fellow-countrymen or
          fellow-townsmen for a single decade. Moreover, the philosophers
          thought that they were thereby raising themselves above the
          moralists! Thus it will be found that the celebrated teachings of
          Schopenhauer as to the supremacy of the will over the intellect, of
          the immutability of character, the negativity of pleasure—all
          errors, in the sense in which he understands them—rest upon
          principles of popular wisdom enunciated by the moralists. Take the
          very word <span>“will,”</span> which Schopenhauer
          twisted so as to become a common denotation of several human
          conditions and with which he filled a gap in the language (to his
          own great advantage, in so far as he was a moralist, for he became
          free to speak of the will as Pascal had spoken of it). In the hands of its
          creator, Schopenhauer's <span>“will,”</span>
          through the philosophic craze for generalisation, already turned
          out to be a bane to knowledge. For this will was made into a poetic
          metaphor, when it was held that all things in nature possess will.
          Finally, that it might be applied to all kinds of disordered
          mysticism, the word was misused by a fraudulent convention. So now
          all our fashionable philosophers repeat it and seem to be perfectly
          certain that all things have a will and are in fact One Will.
          According to the description generally given of this All-One-Will,
          this is much as if one should positively try to have the stupid
          Devil for one's God.</p>

<span>7.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Enmity to
          Light.</span></span>—If we make it clear to any one that, strictly,
          he can never speak of truth, but only of probability and of its
          degrees, we generally discover, from the undisguised joy of our
          pupil, how greatly men prefer the uncertainty of their intellectual
          horizon, and how in their heart of hearts they hate truth because
          of its definiteness.—Is this due to a secret fear felt by all that
          the light of truth may at some time be turned too brightly upon
          themselves? To their wish to be of some consequence, and
          accordingly their concealment from the world of what they are? Or is it to be traced to
          their horror of the all-too brilliant light, to which their
          crepuscular, easily dazzled, bat-like souls are not accustomed, so
          that hate it they must?</p>

<p><span><span>Christian
          Scepticism.</span></span>—Pilate, with his question, <span>“What is Truth?”</span> is now gleefully brought on the
          scene as an advocate of Christ, in order to cast suspicion on all
          that is known or knowable as being mere appearance, and to erect
          the Cross on the appalling background of the Impossibility of
          Knowledge.</p>

<h2>
<span>9.</span></h2>
<p><span><span><span>“</span><span>Natural Law,</span><span>”</span></span> <span>a Phrase of
          Superstition.</span></span>—When you talk so delightedly of Nature
          acting according to law, you must either assume that all things in
          Nature follow their law from a voluntary obedience imposed by
          themselves—in which case you admire the morality of Nature: or you
          are enchanted with the idea of a creative mechanician, who has made
          a most cunning watch with human beings as accessory
          ornaments.—Necessity, through the expression, <span>“conformity to law,”</span> then becomes more human and
          a coign of refuge in the last instance for mythological
          reveries.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>10.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Fallen Forfeit
          to History.</span></span>—All misty philosophers and obscurers of
          the world, in other words all metaphysicians of coarse or refined
          texture are seized with eyeache, earache, and toothache when they begin to
          suspect that there is truth in the saying: <span>“All philosophy has from now fallen forfeit to
          history.”</span> In view of their aches and pains we may pardon
          them for throwing stones and filth at him who talks like this, but
          this teaching may itself thereby become dirty and disreputable for
          a time and lose in effect.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>11.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Pessimist
          of the Intellect.</span></span>—He whose intellect is really free
          will think freely about the intellect itself, and will not shut his
          eyes to certain terrible aspects of its source and tendency. For
          this reason others will perhaps designate him the bitterest
          opponent of free thought and give him that dreadful, abusive name
          of <span>“pessimist of the intellect”</span>:
          accustomed as they are to typify a man not by his strong point, his
          pre-eminent virtue, but by the quality that is most foreign to his
          nature.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>12.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The
          Metaphysicians' Knapsack.</span></span>—To all who talk so
          boastfully of the scientific basis of their metaphysics it is best
          to make no reply. It is enough to tug at the bundle that they
          rather shyly keep hidden behind their backs. If one succeeds in
          lifting it, the results of that <span>“scientific
          basis”</span> come to light, to their great confusion: a dear
          little <span>“God,”</span> a genteel immortality,
          perhaps a little spiritualism, and in any case a complicated mass of
          poor-sinners'-misery and pharisee-arrogance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>13.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Occasional
          Harmfulness of Knowledge.</span></span>—The utility involved in the
          unchecked investigation of knowledge is so constantly proved in a
          hundred different ways that one must remember to include in the
          bargain the subtler and rarer damage which individuals must suffer
          on that account. The chemist cannot avoid occasionally being
          poisoned or burnt at his experiments. What applies to the chemist,
          is true of the whole of our culture. This, it may be added, clearly
          shows that knowledge should provide itself with healing balsam
          against burns and should always have antidotes ready against
          poisons.</p>

<h2>
<span>14.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Craving of
          the Philistine.</span></span>—The Philistine thinks that his most
          urgent need is a purple patch or turban of metaphysics, nor will he
          let it slip. Yet he would look less ridiculous without this
          adornment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>15.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Enthusiasts.</span></span>—With all that
          enthusiasts say in favour of their gospel or their master they are
          defending themselves, however much they comport themselves as the
          judges and not the accused: because they are involuntarily reminded
          almost at every moment that they are exceptions and have to assert
          their legitimacy.</p>

<div>

<span>16.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Good
          Seduces to Life.</span></span>—All good things, even all good books
          that are written against life, are strong means of attraction to
          life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>17.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Happiness
          of the Historian.</span></span>—<span>“When we
          hear the hair-splitting metaphysicians and prophets of the
          after-world speak, we others feel indeed that we are the
          <span>‘poor in spirit,’</span> but that ours is
          the heavenly kingdom of change, with spring and autumn, summer and
          winter, and theirs the after-world, with its grey, everlasting
          frosts and shadows.”</span> Thus soliloquised a man as he walked in
          the morning sunshine, a man who in his pursuit of history has
          constantly changed not only his mind but his heart. In contrast to
          the metaphysicians, he is happy to harbour in himself not an
          <span>“immortal soul”</span> but many <em><span>mortal</span></em>
          souls.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>18.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Three Varieties
          of Thinkers.</span></span>—There are streaming, flowing, trickling
          mineral springs, and three corresponding varieties of thinkers. The
          layman values them by the volume of the water, the expert by the
          contents of the water—in other words, by the elements in them that
          are not water.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>19.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Picture of

          as it has been attempted <span>020</span><a></a>
          by poets and philosophers, is nevertheless irrational. Even in the
          hands of the greatest artist-thinkers, pictures and miniatures of
          one life only—their own—have come into being, and indeed no other
          result is possible. While in the process of developing, a thing
          that develops, cannot mirror itself as fixed and permanent, as a
          <em><span>definite
          object</span></em>.</p>

<h2>
<span>20.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Truth will have

          highly dangerous journey over glaciers and frozen seas, we find
          that those who do not care to travel on this track are offended, as
          if they had been reproached with cowardice and weak knees. The
          difficult, which we find to be beyond our powers, must not even be

          embraced hope. In so far as his impulse belongs to the great
          incurable impulses of human nature, he can bring about tragic

<p><span><span>From the Most
          Intimate Experience of the Thinker.</span></span>—Nothing is harder
          for a man than to conceive of an object impersonally, I mean to see
          in it an object and not a person. One may even ask whether it is
          possible for him to dispense for a single moment with the machinery
          of his instinct to create and construct a personality. After all,
          he associates with his thoughts, however abstract they may be, as
          with individuals, against whom he must fight or to whom he must
          attach himself, whom he must protect, support and nourish. Let us
          watch or listen to ourselves at the moment when we hear or discover
          a new idea. Perhaps it displeases us because it is so defiant and
          so autocratic, and we unconsciously ask ourselves whether we cannot
          place a contradiction of it by its side as an enemy, or fasten on
          to it a <span>“perhaps”</span> or a <span>“sometimes”</span>: the mere little word <span>“probably”</span> gives us a feeling of satisfaction,
          for it shatters the oppressive tyranny of the unconditional. If, on
          the other hand, the new idea enters in gentle shape, sweetly
          patient and humble, and falling at once into the arms of
          contradiction, we put our autocracy to the test in another way. Can
          we not come to the aid of this weak creature, stroke it and feed
          it, give it strength and fulness, and truth and even
          unconditionality? Is it possible for us to show ourselves parental
          or chivalrous or compassionate towards our idea?—Then again, we see
          here a judgment and there a judgment, sundered from each other,
          never looking at or making any movement towards each other. So we are tickled by the
          thought, whether it be not here feasible to make a match, to draw a
          <em><span>conclusion</span></em>, with the anticipation
          that if a consequence follows this conclusion it is not only the
          two judgments united in wedlock but the matchmakers that will gain
          honour. If, however, we cannot acquire a hold upon that thought
          either on the path of defiance and ill-will or on that of good-will
          (if we hold it to be true)—then we submit to it and do homage to it
          as a leader and a prince, give it a chair of honour, and speak not
          of it without a flourish of trumpets: for we are bright in its
          brightness. Woe to him who tries to dim this brightness! Perhaps we
          ourselves one day grow suspicious of our idea. Then we, the
          indefatigable <span>“king-makers”</span> of the
          history of the intellect, cast it down from its throne and
          immediately exalt its adversary. Surely if this be considered and
          thought out a little further, no one will speak of an <span>“absolute impulse to knowledge”</span>!</p>
<p>Why, then, does
          man prefer the true to the untrue, in this secret combat with
          thought-personalities, in this generally clandestine match-making
          of thoughts, constitution-founding of thoughts, child-rearing of
          thoughts, nursing and almsgiving of thoughts? For the same reason
          that he practises honesty in intercourse with real persons:
          <em><span>now</span></em> from habit, heredity, and
          training, <em><span>originally</span></em> because the true, like
          the fair and the just, is more expedient and more reputable than
          the untrue. For in the realm of thought it is difficult to assume a
          power and glory that are built on error or on falsehood. The
          feeling that such an edifice might at some time collapse is
          humiliating to the
          self-esteem of the architect—he is ashamed of the fragility of the
          material, and, as he considers himself more important than the rest
          of the world, he would fain construct nothing that is less durable
          than the rest of the world. In his longing for truth he embraces
          the belief in a personal immortality, the most arrogant and defiant
          idea that exists, closely allied as it is to the underlying
          thought, <span><span>pereat mundus, dum ego salvus
          sim!</span></span> His work has become his <span>“ego,”</span> he transforms himself into the
          Imperishable with its universal challenge. It is his immeasurable
          pride that will only employ the best and hardest stones for the
          work—truths, or what he holds for such. Arrogance has always been
          justly called the <span>“vice of the
          sage”</span>; yet without this vice, fruitful in impulses, Truth
          and her status on earth would be in a parlous plight. In our
          propensity to fear our thoughts, concepts and words, and yet to
          honour ourselves in them, unconsciously to ascribe to them the
          power of rewarding, despising, praising, and blaming us, and so to
          associate with them as with free intellectual personalities, as
          with independent powers, as with our equals—herein lie the roots of
          the remarkable phenomenon which I have called <span>“intellectual conscience.”</span> Thus something of the
          highest moral species has bloomed from a black root.</p>

<p><span><span>The
          Obscurantists.</span></span>—The essential feature of the black art
          of obscurantism is not its intention of clouding the brain, but its
          attempt to darken <span>025</span><a></a>
          the picture of the world and cloud our idea of existence. It often
          employs the method of thwarting all illumination of the intellect,
          but at times it uses the very opposite means, seeking by the
          highest refinement of the intellect to induce a satiety of the
          intellect's fruits. Hair-splitting metaphysicians, who pave the way
          for scepticism and by their excessive acumen provoke a distrust of
          acumen, are excellent instruments of the more subtle form of
          obscurantism.—Is it possible that even Kant may be applied to this
          purpose? Did he even <em><span>intend</span></em> something of the sort, for
          a time at least, to judge from his own notorious exposition:
          <span>“to clear the way for belief by setting
          limitations to knowledge”</span>?—Certainly he did not succeed, nor
          did his followers, on the wolf and fox tracks of this highly
          refined and dangerous form of obscurantism—the most dangerous of
          all, for the black art here appears in the garb of light.</p>

<p><span><span>By what Kind of

          phenomena <em><span>opaque</span></em>, it follows that these
          phenomena cannot be comparatively valued, inasmuch as each becomes
          individually inexplicable. But when once they cannot be compared
          for the sake of valuation, there arises an entire
          absence-of-criticism, a blind indulgence. From this source springs
          a continual diminution of the enjoyment of art (which is only
          distinguished from the crude satisfaction of a need <span>026</span><a></a> by the highest refinement of taste and
          appreciation). The more taste diminishes, the more does the desire
          for art change and revert to a vulgar hunger, which the artist
          henceforth seeks to appease by ever coarser fare.</p>

          want to weave the woof together again and entangle it and so turn
          the conceived into the unconceived and if possible inconceivable.
          Whatever the result may be, the woof and knot always look rather
          untidy, because too many hands are working and tugging at them.</p>

          as <span>“philosophic systems.”</span> With magic
          powers of deception they show him that the solution of all riddles
          and the most refreshing draught of true water of life are close at

          <span>027</span><a></a> his lips the goal of
          all scientific endurance and hardship, so that almost unconsciously
          he presses forward. Other natures stand still, as if spellbound by
          the beautiful illusion: the desert swallows them up, they become
          lost to science. Other natures, again, that have often experienced
          these subjective consolations, become very disheartened and curse
          the salty taste which these mirages leave behind in the mouth and
          from which springs a raging thirst—without one's having come one

<p><span><span>The
          So-called</span> <span><span>“</span><span>Real Reality.</span><span>”</span></span></span>—When the poet
          depicts the various callings—such as those of the warrior, the
          silk-weaver, the sailor—he feigns to know all these things
          thoroughly, to be an expert. Even in the exposition of human
          actions and destinies he behaves as if he had been present at the
          spinning of the whole web of existence. In so far he is an
          impostor. He practises his frauds on pure ignoramuses, and that is
          why he succeeds. They praise him for his deep, genuine knowledge,
          and lead him finally into the delusion that he really knows as much
          as the individual experts and creators, yes, even as the great
          world-spinners themselves. In the end, the impostor becomes honest,
          and actually believes in his own sincerity. Emotional people say to
          his very face that he has the <span>“higher”</span> truth and sincerity—for they are weary
          of reality for the time being, and accept the poetic dream as a
          pleasant relaxation and a night's rest for head and heart. The
          visions of the dream <span>028</span><a></a>
          now appear to them of more value, because, as has been said, they
          find them more beneficial, and mankind has always held that what is
          apparently of more value is more true, more real. All that is
          generally called reality, the poets, conscious of this power,
          proceed with intention to disparage and to distort into the
          uncertain, the illusory, the spurious, the impure, the sinful,
          sorrowful, and deceitful. They make use of all doubts about the
          limits of knowledge, of all sceptical excesses, in order to spread
          over everything the rumpled veil of uncertainty. For they desire
          that when this darkening process is complete their wizardry and
          soul-magic may be accepted without hesitation as the path to
          <span>“true truth”</span> and <span>“real reality.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Wish to be
          Just and the Wish to be a Judge.</span></span>—Schopenhauer, whose
          profound understanding of what is human and all-too-human and
          original sense for facts was not a little impaired by the bright
          leopard-skin of his metaphysic (the skin must first be pulled off
          him if one wants to find the real moralist genius
          beneath)—Schopenhauer makes this admirable distinction, wherein he
          comes far nearer the mark than he would himself dare to admit:
          <span>“Insight into the stern necessity of human
          actions is the boundary line that divides philosophic from other
          brains.”</span> He worked against that wonderful insight of which
          he was sometimes capable by the prejudice that he had in common
          with the moral man (not the moralist), a prejudice that he
          expresses quite guilelessly and devoutly as <span>029</span><a></a> follows: <span>“The
          ultimate and true explanation of the inner being of the entirety of
          things must of necessity be closely connected with that about the
          ethical significance of human actions.”</span> This connection is
          not <span>“necessary”</span> at all: such a
          connection must rather be rejected by that principle of the stern
          necessity of human actions, that is, the unconditioned non-freedom
          and non-responsibility of the will. Philosophic brains will
          accordingly be distinguished from others by their disbelief in the
          metaphysical significance of morality. This must create between the
          two kinds of brain a gulf of a depth and unbridgeableness of which
          the much-deplored gulf between <span>“cultured”</span> and <span>“uncultured”</span> scarcely gives a conception. It is
          true that many back doors, which the <span>“philosophic brains,”</span> like Schopenhauer's own,
          have left for themselves, must be recognised as useless. None leads
          into the open, into the fresh air of the free will, but every door
          through which people had slipped hitherto showed behind it once
          more the gleaming brass wall of fate. For we are in a prison, and
          can only dream of freedom, not make ourselves free. That the
          recognition of this fact cannot be resisted much longer is shown by
          the despairing and incredible postures and grimaces of those who
          still press against it and continue their wrestling-bout with it.
          Their attitude at present is something like this: <span>“So no one is responsible for his actions? And all is
          full of guilt and the consciousness of guilt? But some one
          <em><span>must</span></em> be the sinner. If it is no
          longer possible or permissible to accuse and sentence the
          individual, the one poor wave in the inevitable rough-and-tumble of
          the waves of development—well, then, let this stormy sea, this development
          itself, be the sinner. Here is free will: this totality can be
          accused and sentenced, can atone and expiate. <em><span>So let God be the
          sinner and man his redeemer.</span></em> Let the world's history be
          guilt, expiation, and self-murder. Let the evil-doer be his own
          judge, the judge his own hangman.”</span> This Christianity
          strained to its limits—for what else is it?—is the last thrust in
          the fencing-match between the teaching of unconditioned morality
          and the teaching of unconditioned non-freedom. It would be quite
          horrible if it were anything more than a logical pose, a hideous
          grimace of the underlying thought, perhaps the death-convulsion of
          the heart that seeks a remedy in its despair, the heart to which
          delirium whispers: <span>“Behold, thou art the
          lamb which taketh away the sin of God.”</span> This error lies not
          only in the feeling, <span>“I am
          responsible,”</span> but just as much in the contradiction,
          <span>“I am not responsible, but some one must
          be.”</span> That is simply not true. Hence the philosopher must
          say, like Christ, <span>“Judge not,”</span> and
          the final distinction between the philosophic brains and the others
          would be that the former wish to be just and the latter wish to be
          judges.</p>

          without Consciousness of Sin.</span></span>—If men only committed
          such deeds as do not give rise to a bad conscience, the human world
          would still look bad and rascally enough, but not so sickly and
          pitiable as at present.—Enough wicked men without conscience have
          existed at all times, and many good honest folk lack the feeling of
          pleasure in a good conscience.</p>

<p><span><span>The
          Conscientious.</span></span>—It is more convenient to follow one's
          conscience than one's intelligence, for at every failure conscience
          finds an excuse and an encouragement in itself. That is why there
          are so many conscientious and so few intelligent people.</p>

<p><span><span>Opposite Means
          of Avoiding Bitterness.</span></span>—One temperament finds it
          useful to be able to give vent to its disgust in words, being made
          sweeter by speech. Another reaches its full bitterness only by
          speaking out: it is more advisable for it to have to gulp down
          something—the restraint that men of this stamp place upon themselves in the presence
          of enemies and superiors improves their character and prevents it
          from becoming too acrid and sour.</p>

<p><span><span>Not to be Too
          Dejected.</span></span>—To get bed-sores is unpleasant, but no
          proof against the merits of the cure that prescribes that you
          should take to your bed. Men who have long lived outside
          themselves, and have at last devoted themselves to the inward
          philosophic life, know that one can also get sores of character and
          intellect. This, again, is on the whole no argument against the
          chosen way of life, but necessitates a few small exceptions and
          apparent relapses.</p>

<p><span><span>The

          nay, through being wounded its strength increases and can grow to
          giant proportions.</p>

<p><span><span>The Possession

          he is not the cleverest of men, although he has reached the very

<p><span><span>In the Mirror
          of Nature.</span></span>—Is not a man fairly well described, when
          we are told that he likes to walk between tall fields of golden
          corn: that he prefers the forest and flower colours of sere and
          chilly autumn to all others, because they point to something more
          beautiful than Nature has ever attained: that he feels as much at
          home under big broad-leaved walnut trees as among his nearest
          kinsfolk: that in the mountains his greatest joy is to come across
          those tiny distant lakes from which the very eyes of solitude seem
          to peer at him: that he loves that grey calm of the misty twilight
          that steals along the windows on autumn and early winter evenings
          and shuts out all soulless sounds as with velvet curtains: that in
          unhewn stones he recognises the last remaining traces of the
          primeval age, eager for speech, and honours them from childhood
          upwards: that, lastly, the sea with its shifting serpent skin and
          wild-beast beauty is, and remains to him, unfamiliar?—Yes,
          something of the man is described herewith, but the mirror of
          Nature does not say that the same man, with (and not even
          <span>“in spite of”</span>) all his idyllic
          sensibilities, might be disagreeable, stingy, and conceited.
          Horace, who was a good judge of such matters, in his famous
          <span><span>beatus ille qui procul negotiis</span></span>
          puts the tenderest feeling for country life into the mouth of a
          Roman money-lender.</p>

<span>50.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Power without
          Victory.</span></span>—The strongest cognition (that of the
          complete non-freedom of the human will) is yet the poorest in
          results, for it has always had the mightiest of opponents—human
          vanity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>51.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Pleasure and
          Error.</span></span>—A beneficial influence on friends is exerted
          by one man unconsciously, through his nature; by another
          consciously, through isolated actions. Although the former nature
          is held to be the higher, the latter alone is allied to good
          conscience and pleasure—the pleasure in justification by good
          works, which rests upon a belief in the volitional character of our
          good and evil doing—that is to say, upon a mistake.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>52.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Folly of
          Committing Injustice.</span></span>—The injustice we have inflicted
          ourselves is far harder to bear than the injustice inflicted upon
          us by others (not always from moral grounds, be it observed). After
          all, the doer is always the sufferer—that is, if he be capable of
          feeling the sting of conscience or of perceiving that by his action
          he has armed society against himself and cut himself off. For this
          reason we should beware still more of doing than of suffering
          injustice, for the sake of our own inward happiness—so as not to
          lose our feeling of well-being—quite apart from any consideration
          of the precepts of religion and morality. For in suffering
          injustice we have the consolation of a good conscience, of hope and of revenge,
          together with the sympathy and applause of the just, nay of the
          whole of society, which is afraid of the evil-doer. Not a few are
          skilled in the impure self-deception that enables them to transform
          every injustice of their own into an injustice inflicted upon them
          from without, and to reserve for their own acts the exceptional
          right to the plea of self-defence. Their object, of course, is to
          make their own burden lighter.</p>

<h2>
<span>53.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Envy with or
          without a Mouthpiece.</span></span>—Ordinary envy is wont to cackle
          when the envied hen has laid an egg, thereby relieving itself and
          becoming milder. But there is a yet deeper envy that in such a case
          becomes dead silent, desiring that every mouth should be sealed and
          always more and more angry because this desire is not gratified.
          Silent envy grows in silence.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>54.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Anger as a
          Spy.</span></span>—Anger exhausts the soul and brings its very
          dregs to light. Hence, if we know no other means of gaining
          certainty, we must understand how to arouse anger in our dependents
          and adversaries, in order to learn what is really done and thought
          to our detriment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>55.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Defence Morally
          more Difficult than Attack.</span></span>—The true heroic deed and
          masterpiece of the good man does not lie in attacking opinions and continuing to
          love their propounders, but in the far harder task of defending his
          own position without causing or intending to cause bitter
          heartburns to his opponent. The sword of attack is honest and
          broad, the sword of defence usually runs out to a needle point.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>56.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Honest towards
          Honesty.</span></span>—One who is openly honest towards himself
          ends by being rather conceited about this honesty. He knows only
          too well why he is honest—for the same reason that another man
          prefers outward show and hypocrisy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>57.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Coals of
          Fire.</span></span>—The heaping of coals of fire on another's head
          is generally misunderstood and falls flat, because the other knows
          himself to be just as much in the right, and on his side too has
          thought of collecting coals.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>58.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Dangerous
          Books.</span></span>—A man says: <span>“Judging
          from my own case, I find that this book is harmful.”</span> Let him
          but wait, and perhaps one day he will confess that the book did him
          a great service by thrusting forward and bringing to light the
          hidden disease of his soul.—Altered opinions alter not at all (or
          very little) the character of a man: but they illuminate individual
          facets of his personality, which hitherto, in another constellation
          of opinions, had remained dark and unrecognisable.</p>
</div><span>039</span><a></a>
<div>
<h2>
<span>59.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Simulated
          Pity.</span></span>—We simulate pity when we wish to show ourselves
          superior to the feeling of animosity, but generally in vain. This
          point is not noticed without a considerable enhancement of that
          feeling of animosity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>60.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Open
          Contradiction often Conciliatory.</span></span>—At the moment when
          a man openly makes known his difference of opinion from a
          well-known party leader, the whole world thinks that he must be
          angry with the latter. Sometimes, however, he is just on the point
          of ceasing to be angry with him. He ventures to put himself on the
          same plane as his opponent, and is free from the tortures of
          suppressed envy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>61.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Seeing our
          Light Shining.</span></span>—In the darkest hour of depression,
          sickness, and guilt, we are still glad to see others taking a light
          from us and making use of us as of the disk of the moon. By this
          roundabout route we derive some light from our own illuminating
          faculty.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>62.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Fellowship in
          Joy.</span></span><span>5</span><a></a>—The
          snake that stings us means to hurt us and rejoices in so doing: the
          lowest animal can picture to itself the <em><span>pain</span></em> of
          others. <span>040</span><a></a>
          But to picture to oneself the <em><span>joy</span></em> of others and to rejoice
          thereat is the highest privilege of the highest animals, and again,
          amongst them, is the property only of the most select
          specimens—accordingly a rare <span>“human
          thing.”</span> Hence there have been philosophers who denied

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>63.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Supplementary
          Pregnancy.</span></span>—Those who have arrived at works and deeds
          are in an obscure way, they know not how, all the more pregnant
          with them, as if to prove supplementarily that these are their
          children and not those of chance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>64.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Hard-hearted
          from Vanity.</span></span>—Just as justice is so often a cloak for
          weakness, so men who are fairly intelligent, but weak, sometimes
          attempt dissimulation from ambitious motives and purposely show
          themselves unjust and hard, in order to leave behind them the
          impression of strength.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>65.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Humiliation.</span></span>—If in a large

          Herostratuses who set fire to their own temple, in which their
          images are honoured.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>67.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A World of
          Diminutives.</span></span>—The fact that all that is weak and in
          need of help appeals to the heart induces in us the habit of
          designating by diminutive and softening terms all that appeals to
          our hearts—and accordingly <em><span>making</span></em> such things weak and
          clinging to our imaginations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>68.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Bad
          Characteristic of Sympathy.</span></span>—Sympathy has a peculiar
          impudence for its companion. For, wishing to help at all costs,
          sympathy is in no perplexity either as to the means of assistance
          or as to the nature and cause of the disease, and goes on
          courageously administering all its quack medicines to restore the
          health and reputation of the patient.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>69.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Importunacy.</span></span>—There is even
          an importunacy in relation to works, and the act of associating
          oneself from early youth on an intimate footing with the
          illustrious works of all times evinces an entire absence of
          shame.—Others are only importunate from ignorance, not knowing with
          whom they have to do—for instance classical scholars young and old
          in relation to the works of the Greeks.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>70.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Will is
          Ashamed of the Intellect.</span></span>—In all coolness we make
          reasonable plans against our passions. But we make the most serious
          mistake in this connection in being often ashamed, when the design
          has to be carried out, of the coolness and calculation with which
          we conceived it. So we do just the unreasonable thing, from that
          sort of defiant magnanimity that every passion involves.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>71.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Why the
          Sceptics Offend Morality.</span></span>—He who takes his morality
          solemnly and seriously is enraged against the sceptics in the
          domain of morals. For where he lavishes all his force, he wishes
          others to marvel but not to investigate and doubt. Then there are
          natures whose last shred of morality is just the belief in morals.
          They behave in the same way towards sceptics, if possible still
          more passionately.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>72.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Shyness.</span></span>—All moralists are
          shy, because they know they are confounded with spies and traitors,
          so soon as their penchant is noticed. Besides, they are generally
          conscious of being impotent in action, for in the midst of work the
          motives of their activity almost withdraw their attention from the
          work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>73.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Danger to
          Universal Morality.</span></span>—People who are at the same time
          noble and honest come to deify every devilry that brings out their honesty, and to
          suspend for a time the balance of their moral judgment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>74.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Saddest
          Error.</span></span>—It is an unpardonable offence when one
          discovers that where one was convinced of being loved, one is only
          regarded as a household utensil and decoration, whereby the master
          of the house can find an outlet for his vanity before his
          guests.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>75.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Love and
          Duality.</span></span>—What else is love but understanding and
          rejoicing that another lives, works, and feels in a different and
          opposite way to ourselves? That love may be able to bridge over the
          contrasts by joys, we must not remove or deny those contrasts. Even
          self-love presupposes an irreconcileable duality (or plurality) in
          one person.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>76.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Signs from
          Dreams.</span></span>—What one sometimes does not know and feel
          accurately in waking hours—whether one has a good or a bad
          conscience as regards some person—is revealed completely and
          unambiguously by dreams.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>77.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Debauchery.</span></span>—Not joy but
          joylessness is the mother of debauchery.</p>
</div><span>044</span><a></a>
<div>
<h2>
<span>78.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Reward and
          Punishment.</span></span>—No one accuses without an underlying
          notion of punishment and revenge, even when he accuses his fate or
          himself. All complaint is accusation, all self-congratulation is
          praise. Whether we do one or the other, we always make some one
          responsible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>79.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Doubly
          Unjust.</span></span>—We sometimes advance truth by a twofold
          injustice: when we see and represent consecutively the two sides of
          a case which we are not in a position to see together, but in such
          a way that every time we mistake or deny the other side, fancying
          that what we see is the whole truth.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>80.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Mistrust.</span></span>—Self-mistrust
          does not always proceed uncertainly and shyly, but sometimes in a
          furious rage, having worked itself into a frenzy in order not to
          tremble.</p>

<span>82.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Knowing how to
          Wash Oneself Clean.</span></span>—We must know how to emerge

<p><span><span>The Innocent
          Rogue.</span></span>—There is a slow, gradual path to vice and
          rascality of every description. In the end, the traveller is quite
          abandoned by the insect-swarms of a bad conscience, and although a
          thorough scoundrel he walks in innocence.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>85.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Making
          Plans.</span></span>—Making plans and conceiving projects involves
          many agreeable sentiments. He that had the strength to be nothing
          but a contriver of plans all his life would be a happy man. But one
          must occasionally have a rest from this activity by carrying a plan
          into execution, and then comes anger and sobriety.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>86.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Wherewith We
          See the Ideal.</span></span>—Every efficient man is blocked by his
          efficiency and cannot look out freely from its prison. Had he not
          also a goodly share of imperfection, he could, by reason of his
          virtue, never arrive at an intellectual or moral freedom. Our
          shortcomings are the eyes with which we see the ideal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>87.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Dishonest
          Praise.</span></span>—Dishonest praise causes many more twinges of
          conscience than dishonest blame, probably only because we have exposed our capacity for
          judgment far more completely through excessive praise than through
          excessive and unjust blame.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>88.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>How One Dies is
          Indifferent.</span></span>—The whole way in which a man thinks of
          death during the prime of his life and strength is very expressive
          and significant for what we call his character. But the hour of
          death itself, his behaviour on the death-bed, is almost
          indifferent. The exhaustion of waning life, especially when old
          people die, the irregular or insufficient nourishment of the brain
          during this last period, the occasionally violent pain, the novel
          and untried nature of the whole position, and only too often the
          ebb and flow of superstitious impressions and fears, as if dying
          were of much consequence and meant the crossing of bridges of the
          most terrible kind—all this forbids our using death as a testimony
          concerning the living. Nor is it true that the dying man is
          generally more honest than the living. On the contrary, through the
          solemn attitude of the bystanders, the repressed or flowing streams
          of tears and emotions, every one is inveigled into a comedy of
          vanity, now conscious, now unconscious. The serious way in which
          every dying man is treated must have been to many a poor despised
          devil the highest joy of his whole life and a sort of compensation
          and repayment for many privations.</p>

<p><span><span>Morality and
          its Sacrifice.</span></span>—The origin of morality may be traced
          to two ideas: <span>“The community is of more value than the
          individual,”</span> and <span>“The permanent
          interest is to be preferred to the temporary.”</span> The
          conclusion drawn is that the permanent interest of the community is
          unconditionally to be set above the temporary interest of the
          individual, especially his momentary well-being, but also his
          permanent interest and even the prolongation of his existence. Even
          if the individual suffers by an arrangement that suits the mass,
          even if he is depressed and ruined by it, morality must be
          maintained and the victim brought to the sacrifice. Such a trend of
          thought arises, however, only in those who are <em><span>not</span></em> the
          victims—for in the victim's case it enforces the claim that the
          individual might be worth more than the many, and that the present
          enjoyment, the <span>“moment in
          paradise,”</span><span>7</span><a></a> should
          perhaps be rated higher than a tame succession of untroubled or
          comfortable circumstances. But the philosophy of the sacrificial
          victim always finds voice too late, and so victory remains with
          morals and morality: which are really nothing more than the
          sentiment for the whole concept of morals under which one lives and
          has been reared—and reared not as an individual but as a member of
          the whole, as a cipher in a majority. Hence it constantly happens
          that the individual makes himself into a majority by means of his
          morality.</p>

<p><span><span>The Good and
          the Good Conscience.</span></span>—You hold that all good things
          have at all times had a good conscience? Science, which is certainly a very good thing, has
          come into the world without such a conscience and quite free from
          all pathos, rather clandestinely, by roundabout ways, walking with
          shrouded or masked face like a sinner, and always with the feeling
          at least of being a smuggler. Good conscience has bad conscience
          for its stepping-stone, not for its opposite. For all that is good
          has at one time been new and consequently strange, against morals,
          immoral, and has gnawed like a worm at the heart of the fortunate
          discoverer.</p>

<p><span><span>Success
          Sanctifies the Intentions.</span></span>—We should not shrink from
          treading the road to a virtue, even when we see clearly that
          nothing but egotism, and accordingly utility, personal comfort,
          fear, considerations of health, reputation, or glory, are the
          impelling motives. These motives are styled ignoble and selfish.
          Very well, but if they stimulate us to some virtue—for example,
          self-denial, dutifulness, order, thrift, measure, and
          moderation—let us listen to them, whatever their epithets may be!
          For if we reach the goal to which they summon us, then the virtue
          we have attained, by means of the pure air it makes us breathe and
          the spiritual well-being it communicates, ennobles the remoter
          impulses of our action, and afterwards we no longer perform those
          actions from the same coarse motives that inspired us
          before.—Education should therefore force the virtues on the pupil,
          as far as possible, according to his disposition. Then virtue, the
          sunshine and summer atmosphere of the soul, can contribute her own share of work
          and add mellowness and sweetness.</p>

<p><span>“<span><span>Love.</span></span>”</span>—The finest
          artistic conception wherein Christianity had the advantage over
          other religious systems lay in one word—Love. Hence it became the <em><span>lyric</span></em>
          religion (whereas in its two other creations Semitism bestowed
          heroico-epical religions upon the world). In the word <span>“love”</span> there is so much meaning, so much that
          stimulates and appeals to memory and hope, that even the meanest
          intelligence and the coldest heart feel some glimmering of its
          sense. The cleverest woman and the lowest man think of the
          comparatively unselfish moments of their whole life, even if with
          them Eros never soared high: and the vast number of beings who
          <em><span>miss</span></em> love from their parents or
          children or sweethearts, especially those whose sexual instincts
          have been refined away, have found their heart's desire in

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>96.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Fulfilment
          of Christianity.</span></span>—In Christianity there is also an
          Epicurean trend of thought, starting from the idea that God can
          only demand of man, his creation and his image, what it is possible
          for man to fulfil, and accordingly that Christian virtue and
          perfection are attainable and often attained. Now, for instance,
          the belief in loving one's enemies—even if it is only a belief or
          fancy, and by no means a psychological reality (a real love)—gives
          unalloyed happiness, so long as it is genuinely believed. (As to
          the reason of this, psychologist and Christian might well differ.)
          Hence earthly life, through the belief, I mean the fancy, that it
          satisfies not only the injunction to love our enemies, but all the
          other injunctions of Christianity, and that it has really
          assimilated and embodied in itself the Divine perfection according to the
          command, <span>“Be perfect as your Father in
          heaven is perfect,”</span> might actually become a holy life. Thus
          error can make Christ's promise come true.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>97.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Of the Future
          of Christianity.</span></span>—We may be allowed to form a
          conjecture as to the disappearance of Christianity and as to the
          places where it will be the slowest to retreat, if we consider
          where and for what reasons Protestantism spread with such startling
          rapidity. As is well known, Protestantism promised to do far more
          cheaply all that the old Church did, without costly masses,
          pilgrimages, and priestly pomp and circumstance. It spread
          particularly among the Northern nations, which were not so deeply
          rooted as those of the South in the old Church's symbolism and love
          of ritual. In the South the more powerful pagan religion survived
          in Christianity, whereas in the North Christianity meant an
          opposition to and a break with the old-time creed, and hence was
          from the first more thoughtful and less sensual, but for that very
          reason, in times of peril, more fanatical and more obstinate. If
          from the standpoint of <em><span>thought</span></em> we succeed in uprooting
          Christianity, we can at once know the point where it will begin to
          disappear—the very point at which it will be most stubborn in
          defence. In other places it will bend but not break, lose its
          leaves but burst into leaf afresh, because the senses, and not
          thought, have gone over to its side. But it is the senses
          that maintain the
          belief that with all its expensive outlay the Church is more
          cheaply and conveniently managed than under the stern conditions of
          work and wages. Yet what does one hold leisure (or semi-idleness)
          to be worth, when once one has become accustomed to it? The senses
          plead against a dechristianised world, saying that there would be
          too much work to do in it and an insufficient supply of leisure.
          They take the part of magic—that is, they let God work himself
          (<span><span>oremus nos, Deus laboret</span></span>).</p>

<p><span><span>Theatricality
          and Honesty of Unbelievers.</span></span>—There is no book that
          contains in such abundance or expresses so faithfully all that man
          occasionally finds salutary—ecstatic inward happiness, ready for
          sacrifice or death in the belief in and contemplation of <em><span>his</span></em>
          truth—as the book that tells of Christ. From that book a clever man
          may learn all the means whereby a book can be made into a
          world-book, a vade-mecum for all, and especially that master-means
          of representing everything as discovered, nothing as future and
          uncertain. All influential books try to leave the same impression,
          as if the widest intellectual horizon were circumscribed here and
          as if about the sun that shines here every constellation visible at
          present or in the future must revolve.—Must not then all purely
          scientific books be poor in influence on the same grounds as such
          books are rich in influence? Is not the book fated to live humble
          and among humble folk, in order to be crucified in the end and
          never resurrected? In relation to what the religious inform us of their <span>“knowledge”</span> and their <span>“holy spirit,”</span> are not all upright men of
          science <span>“poor in spirit”</span>? Can any
          religion demand more self-denial and draw the selfish out of
          themselves more inexorably than science?—This and similar things we
          may say, in any case with a certain theatricality, when we have to
          defend ourselves against believers, for it is impossible to conduct
          a defence without a certain amount of theatricality. But between
          ourselves our language must be more honest, and we employ a freedom
          that those believers are not even allowed, in their own interests,
          to understand. Away, then, with the monastic cowl of self-denial,
          with the appearance of humility! Much more and much better—so rings
          our truth! If science were not linked with the pleasure of
          knowledge, the utility of the thing known, what should we care for
          science? If a little faith, love, and hope did not lead our souls
          to knowledge, what would attract us to science? And if in science
          the ego means nothing, still the inventive, happy ego, every
          upright and industrious ego, means a great deal in the republic of
          the men of science. The homage of those who pay homage, the joy of
          those whom we wish well or honour, in some cases glory and a fair
          share of immortality, is the personal reward for every suppression
          of personality: to say nothing here of meaner views and rewards,
          although it is just on this account that the majority have sworn
          and always continue to swear fidelity to the laws of the republic
          and of science. If we had not remained in some degree unscientific,
          what would science matter to us? Taking everything together and
          speaking in plain
          language: <span>“To a purely knowing being
          knowledge would be indifferent.”</span>—Not the quality but the
          quantity of faith and devoutness distinguishes us from the pious,
          the believers. We are content with less. But should one of them cry
          out to us: <span>“Be content and show yourselves
          contented!”</span> we could easily answer: <span>“As a matter of fact, we do not belong to the most
          discontented class. But you, if your faith makes you happy, show
          yourselves to be happy. Your faces have always done more harm to
          your faith than our reasons! If that glad message of your Bible
          were written in your faces, you would not need to demand belief in
          the authority of that book in such stiff-necked fashion. Your
          words, your actions should continually make the Bible
          superfluous—in fact, through you a new Bible should continually
          come into being. As it is, your apologia for Christianity is rooted
          in your unchristianity, and with your defence you write your own
          condemnation. If you, however, should wish to emerge from your
          dissatisfaction with Christianity, you should ponder over the
          experience of two thousand years, which, clothed in the modest form
          of a question, may be voiced as follows: <span>‘If Christ really intended to redeem the world, may he
          not be said to have failed?’</span>”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Poet as
          Guide to the Future.</span></span>—All the surplus poetical force
          that still exists in modern humanity, but is not used under our
          conditions of life, should (without any deduction) be devoted to
          a definite goal—not
          to depicting the present nor to reviving and summarising the past,
          but to pointing the way to the future. Nor should this be so done
          as if the poet, like an imaginative political economist, had to
          anticipate a more favourable national and social state of things
          and picture their realisation. Rather will he, just as the earlier
          poets portrayed the images of the Gods, portray the fair images of
          men. He will divine those cases where, in the midst of our modern
          world and reality (which will not be shirked or repudiated in the
          usual poetic fashion), a great, noble soul is still possible, where
          it may be embodied in harmonious, equable conditions, where it may
          become permanent, visible, and representative of a type, and so, by
          the stimulus to imitation and envy, help to create the future. The
          poems of such a poet would be distinguished by appearing secluded
          and protected from the heated atmosphere of the passions. The
          irremediable failure, the shattering of all the strings of the
          human instrument, the scornful laughter and gnashing of teeth, and
          all tragedy and comedy in the usual old sense, would appear by the
          side of this new art as mere archaic lumber, a blurring of the
          outlines of the world-picture. Strength, kindness, gentleness,
          purity, and an unsought, innate moderation in the personalities and
          their action: a levelled soil, giving rest and pleasure to the
          foot: a shining heaven mirrored in faces and events: science and
          art welded into a new unity: the mind living together with her
          sister, the soul, without arrogance or jealousy, and enticing from
          contrasts the grace of seriousness, not the impatience of
          discord—all this would be the general environment, the background on which the
          delicate differences of the embodied ideals would make the real
          picture, that of ever-growing human majesty. Many roads to this
          poetry of the future start from Goethe, but the quest needs good
          pathfinders and above all a far greater strength than is possessed
          by modern poets, who unscrupulously represent the half-animal and
          the immaturity and intemperance that are mistaken by them for power
          and naturalness.</p>

          godfather, when an innocent and beautiful sensation has to be
          christened by you? Are you obliged to dress your noble goddess in a

          obligation?”</span> The reason is—because you live too near the

<p><span><span>Of the Salt of
          Speech.</span></span>—No one has ever explained why the Greek
          writers, having at command such an unparalleled wealth and power of
          language, made so sparing a use of their resources that every
          post-classical Greek book appears by comparison crude,
          over-coloured, and extravagant. It is said that towards the North
          Polar ice and in the hottest countries salt is becoming less and
          less used, whereas on the other hand the dwellers on the plains and
          by the coast in the more temperate zones use salt in great
          abundance. Is it possible that the Greeks from a twofold
          reason—because their intellect was colder and clearer but their
          fundamental passionate nature far more tropical than ours—did not
          need salt and spice to the same extent that we do?</p>

<p><span><span>The Freest
          Writer.</span></span>—In a book for free spirits one cannot avoid
          mention of Laurence Sterne, the man whom Goethe honoured as the
          freest spirit of his century. May he be satisfied with the honour
          of being called the freest writer of all times, in comparison with
          whom all others appear stiff, square-toed, intolerant, and
          downright boorish! In his case we should not speak of the clear and
          rounded but of <span>“the endless
          melody”</span>—if by this phrase we arrive at a name for an
          artistic style in which the definite form is continually broken,
          thrust aside and transferred to the realm of the indefinite, so
          that it signifies one and the other at the same time. Sterne is the
          great master of <span>double entendre</span>, this phrase
          being naturally used in a far wider sense than is commonly done when one applies it to
          sexual relations. We may give up for lost the reader who always
          wants to know exactly what Sterne thinks about a matter, and
          whether he be making a serious or a smiling face (for he can do
          both with one wrinkling of his features; he can be and even wishes
          to be right and wrong at the same moment, to interweave profundity
          and farce). His digressions are at once continuations and further
          developments of the story, his maxims contain a satire on all that
          is sententious, his dislike of seriousness is bound up with a
          disposition to take no matter merely externally and on the surface.
          So in the proper reader he arouses a feeling of uncertainty whether
          he be walking, lying, or standing, a feeling most closely akin to
          that of floating in the air. He, the most versatile of writers,
          communicates something of this versatility to his reader. Yes,
          Sterne unexpectedly changes the parts, and is often as much reader
          as author, his book being like a play within a play, a theatre
          audience before another theatre audience. We must surrender at
          discretion to the mood of Sterne, although we can always expect it
          to be gracious. It is strangely instructive to see how so great a
          writer as Diderot has affected this <span>double
          entendre</span> of Sterne's—to be equally ambiguous
          throughout is just the Sternian super-humour. Did Diderot imitate,
          admire, ridicule, or parody Sterne in his <span>Jacques le
          Fataliste</span>? One cannot be exactly certain, and this
          uncertainty was perhaps intended by the author. This very doubt
          makes the French unjust to the work of one of their first masters,
          one who need not be
          ashamed of comparison with any of the ancients or moderns. For
          humour (and especially for this humorous attitude towards humour
          itself) the French are too serious. Is it necessary to add that of
          all great authors Sterne is the worst model, in fact the inimitable
          author, and that even Diderot had to pay for his daring? What the
          worthy Frenchmen and before them some Greeks and Romans aimed at
          and attained in prose is the very opposite of what Sterne aims at
          and attains. He raises himself as a masterly exception above all
          that artists in writing demand of themselves—propriety, reserve,
          character, steadfastness of purpose, comprehensiveness,
          perspicuity, good deportment in gait and feature. Unfortunately
          Sterne the man seems to have been only too closely related to
          Sterne the writer. His squirrel-soul sprang with insatiable unrest
          from branch to branch; he knew what lies between sublimity and
          rascality; he had sat on every seat, always with unabashed watery
          eyes and mobile play of feature. He was—if language does not revolt
          from such a combination—of a hard-hearted kindness, and in the
          midst of the joys of a grotesque and even corrupt imagination he
          showed the bashful grace of innocence. Such a carnal and spiritual
          hermaphroditism, such untrammelled wit penetrating into every vein
          and muscle, was perhaps never possessed by any other man.</p>

          words that belong to the language of daily intercourse, though not
          by a long way all its words—whence arises a choice style—so the good poet of the
          future will only represent the real and turn his eyes away from all
          fantastic, superstitious, half-voiced, forgotten stories, to which
          earlier poets devoted their powers. Only reality, though by a long

<p><span><span>A Hero
          Impossible from Lack of Colour.</span></span>—The typical poets and
          artists of our age like to compose their pictures upon a background
          of shimmering red, green, grey, and gold, on the background of
          nervous sensuality—a condition well understood by the children of
          this century. The drawback comes when we do <em><span>not</span></em>
          look at these pictures with the eyes of our century. Then we see
          that the great figures painted by these artists have something
          flickering, tremulous, and dizzy about them, and accordingly we do
          not ascribe to them heroic deeds, but at best mock-heroic,
          swaggering <em><span>mis</span></em>deeds.</p>

          reverse conditions sometimes appear.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Pulchrum est

          imagination and carries one beyond everyday reality, is older and
          grows more luxuriantly than the beautiful and reverence for the
          beautiful in art: and that it begins to flourish exceedingly when
          the sense for beauty is on the wane. For the vast majority of
          mankind this grotesque seems to be a higher need than the
          beautiful, presumably because it contains a coarser narcotic.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>119.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Origins of
          Taste in Works of Art.</span></span>—If we consider the primary
          germs of the artistic sense, and ask ourselves what are the various
          kinds of joy produced by the firstlings of art—as, for example,
          among savage tribes—we find first of all the joy of understanding
          what another means. Art in this case is a sort of conundrum, which
          causes its solver pleasure in his own quick and keen
          perceptions.—Then the roughest works of art remind us of the
          pleasant things we have actually experienced, and so give joy—as,
          for example, when the artist alludes to a chase, a victory, a
          wedding.—Again, the representation may cause us to feel excited,
          touched, inflamed, as for instance in the glorification of revenge
          and danger. Here the
          enjoyment lies in the excitement itself, in the victory over
          tedium.—The memory, too, of unpleasant things, so far as they have
          been overcome or make us appear interesting to the listener as
          subjects for art (as when the singer describes the mishaps of a
          daring seaman), can inspire great joy, the credit for which is
          given to art.—A more subtle variety is the joy that arises at the
          sight of all that is regular and symmetrical in lines, points, and
          rhythms. For by a certain analogy is awakened the feeling for all
          that is orderly and regular in life, which one has to thank alone
          for all well-being. So in the cult of symmetry we unconsciously do
          homage to rule and proportion as the source of our previous
          happiness, and the joy in this case is a kind of hymn of
          thanksgiving. Only when a certain satiety of the last-mentioned joy
          arises does a more subtle feeling step in, that enjoyment might
          even lie in a violation of the symmetrical and regular. This
          feeling, for example, impels us to seek reason in apparent
          unreason, and the sort of æsthetic riddle-guessing that results is
          in a way the higher species of the first-named artistic joy.—He who
          pursues this speculation still further will know what kind of
          hypotheses for the explanation of æsthetic phenomena are hereby
          fundamentally rejected.</p>

<p><span><span>Not too

          they follow too closely on one another, for they hide the view from
          each other. That is why great artists and writers have made an abundant use of
          the mediocre.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>121.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Roughness and
          Weakness.</span></span>—Artists of all periods have made the
          discovery that in roughness lies a certain strength, and that not
          every one can be rough who wants to be: also that many varieties of
          weakness have a powerful effect on the emotions. From this source
          are derived many artistic substitutes, which not even the greatest
          and most conscientious artists can abstain from using.</p>

<p><span><span>Arousing
          instead of Appeasing Hunger.</span></span>—Great artists fancy that
          they have taken full possession of a soul. In reality, and often to
          their painful disappointment, that soul has only been made more
          capacious and insatiable, so that a dozen greater artists could
          plunge into its depths without filling it up.</p>

<p><span><span>Artists'
          Anxiety.</span></span>—The anxiety lest people may not believe that
          their figures are <em><span>alive</span></em> can mislead many artists of
          declining taste to portray these figures so that they appear as if
          mad. From the same anxiety, on the other hand, Greek artists of the earliest ages
          gave even dead and sorely wounded men that smile which they knew as
          the most vivid sign of life—careless of the actual forms bestowed
          by nature on life at its last gasp.</p>

<p><span><span>The Circle must

          of art to the end of its career and beyond, understands from inner
          experience why the masters and disciples who come after have so
          often turned, with a depreciatory gesture, into a new groove. The
          circle must be described—but the individual, even the greatest,
          sits firm on his point of the circumference, with an inexorable
          look of obstinacy, as if the circle ought never to be
          completed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>126.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Older Art
          and the Soul of the Present.</span></span>—Since every art becomes
          more and more adapted to the expression of spiritual states, of the
          more lively, delicate, energetic, and passionate states, the later
          masters, spoilt by these means of expression, do not feel at their
          ease in the presence of the old-time works of art. They feel as if
          the ancients had merely been lacking in the means of making their
          souls speak clearly, also perhaps in some necessary technical
          preliminaries. They think that they must render some assistance in
          this quarter, for they believe in the similarity or even unity of
          all souls. In truth, however, measure, symmetry, a contempt for graciousness and charm, an
          unconscious severity and morning chilliness, an evasion of passion,
          as if passion meant the death of art—such are the constituents of
          sentiment and morality in all old masters, who selected and
          arranged their means of expression not at random but in a necessary
          connection with their morality. Knowing this, are we to deny those
          that come after the right to animate the older works with their
          soul? No, for these works can only survive through our giving them
          our soul, and our blood alone enables them to speak to <em><span>us</span></em>. The
          real <span>“historic”</span> discourse would talk
          ghostly speech to ghosts. We honour the great artists less by that
          barren timidity that allows every word, every note to remain intact
          than by energetic endeavours to aid them continually to a new
          life.—True, if Beethoven were suddenly to come to life and hear one
          of his works performed with that modern animation and nervous
          refinement that bring glory to our masters of execution, he would
          probably be silent for a long while, uncertain whether he should
          raise his hand to curse or to bless, but perhaps say at last:
          <span>“Well, well! That is neither I nor not-I,
          but a third thing—it seems to me, too, something right, if not just
          <em><span>the</span></em> right thing. But you must know
          yourselves what to do, as in any case it is you who have to listen.
          As our Schiller says, <span>‘the living man is
          right.’</span> So have it your own way, and let me go down

<p><span><span>How the Soul

          purpose followed by the new music, in what is now forcibly but none
          too lucidly termed
          <span>“endless melody,”</span> can be understood
          by going into the sea, gradually losing one's firm tread on the
          bottom, and finally surrendering unconditionally to the fluid
          element. One has to <em><span>swim</span></em>. In the previous, older music
          one was forced, with delicate or stately or impassioned movement,
          to <em><span>dance</span></em>. The measure necessary for
          dancing, the observance of a distinct balance of time and force in
          the soul of the hearer, imposed a continual self-control. Through
          the counteraction of the cooler draught of air which came from this
          caution and the warmer breath of musical enthusiasm, that music
          exercised its spell.—Richard Wagner aimed at a different excitation
          of the soul, allied, as above said, to swimming and floating. This
          is perhaps the most essential of his innovations. His famous
          method, originating from this aim and adapted to it—the
          <span>“endless melody”</span>—strives to break
          and sometimes even to despise all mathematical equilibrium of time
          and force. He is only too rich in the invention of such effects,
          which sound to the old school like rhythmic paradoxes and
          blasphemies. He dreads petrifaction, crystallisation, the
          development of music into the architectural. He accordingly sets up
          a three-time rhythm in opposition to the double-time, not
          infrequently introduces five-time and seven-time, immediately
          repeats a phrase, but with a prolation, so that its time is again
          doubled and trebled. From an easy-going imitation of such art may
          arise a great danger to music, for by the side of the
          superabundance of rhythmic emotion demoralisation and decadence
          lurk in ambush. The danger will become very great if such music
          comes to associate itself more and more closely with a quite naturalistic art of acting and
          pantomime, trained and dominated by no higher plastic models; an
          art that knows no measure in itself and can impart no measure to
          the kindred element, the all-too-womanish nature of music.</p>

<p><span><span>The Mixed
          Species.</span></span>—The mixed species in art bear witness to
          their authors' distrust of their own strength. They seek auxiliary powers,
          advocates, hiding-places—such is the case with the poet who calls
          in philosophy, the musician who calls in the drama, and the thinker
          who calls in rhetoric to his aid.</p>

<p><span><span>Cold
          Books.</span></span>—The deep thinker reckons on readers who feel
          with him the happiness that lies in deep thinking. Hence a book
          that looks cold and sober, if seen in the right light, may seem
          bathed in the sunshine of spiritual cheerfulness and become a
          genuine soul-comforter.</p>

<p><span><span>A Knack of the
          Slow-Witted.</span></span>—The slow-witted thinker generally allies
          himself with loquacity and ceremoniousness. By the former he thinks
          he is gaining mobility and fluency, by the latter he gives his
          peculiarity the appearance of being a result of free will and
          artistic purpose, with a view to dignity, which needs slow
          movement.</p>

<p><span><span>Le Style Baroque.</span></span><a><span><span>11</span></span></a>—He who
          as thinker and writer is not born or trained to dialectic and the
          consecutive arrangement of ideas, will unconsciously turn to the
          rhetoric and dramatic forms. For, after all, his object is to make
          himself understood and to carry the day by force, and he is
          indifferent whether, as shepherd, he honestly guides to himself the
          hearts of his fellow-men, or, as robber, he captures them by
          surprise. This is true of the plastic arts as of music: where the
          feeling of insufficient dialectic or a deficiency in expression or
          narration, together with an urgent, over-powerful impulse to form,
          gives birth to that species of style known as <span>“baroque.”</span> Only the ill-educated and the
          arrogant will at once find a depreciatory force in this word. The
          baroque style always arises at the time of decay of a great art,
          when the demands of art in classical expression have become too
          great. It is a natural phenomenon which will be observed with
          melancholy—for it is a forerunner of the night—but at the same time
          with admiration for its peculiar compensatory arts of expression
          and narration. To this style belongs already a choice of material
          and subjects of the highest dramatic tension, at which the heart
          trembles even when there is no art, because heaven and hell are all
          too near the emotions: then, the oratory of strong passion and
          gestures, of ugly sublimity, of great masses, in fact of absolute quantity
          <span><span>per
          se</span></span> (as is shown in Michael Angelo, the father or
          grandfather of the Italian baroque stylists): the lights of dusk,
          illumination and conflagration playing upon those strongly moulded
          forms: ever-new ventures in means and aims, strongly underscored by
          artists for artists, while the layman must fancy he sees an
          unconscious overflowing of all the horns of plenty of an original
          nature-art: all these characteristics that constitute the greatness
          of that style are neither possible nor permitted in the earlier
          ante-classical and classical periods of a branch of art. Such
          luxuries hang long on the tree like forbidden fruit. Just now, when
          music is passing into this last phase, we may learn to know the
          phenomenon of the baroque style in peculiar splendour, and, by
          comparison, find much that is instructive for earlier ages. For
          from Greek times onward there has often been a baroque style, in
          poetry, oratory, prose writing, sculpture, and, as is well known,
          in architecture. This style, though wanting in the highest
          nobility,—the nobility of an innocent, unconscious, triumphant
          perfection,—has nevertheless given pleasure to many of the best and
          most serious minds of their time. Hence, as aforesaid, it is
          presumptuous to depreciate it without reserve, however happy we may
          feel because our taste for it has not made us insensible to the
          purer and greater style.</p>

<p><span><span>The Value of Honest Books.</span></span>—Honest books make the reader honest, at

<p><span><span>How Art makes Partisans.</span></span>—Individual fine passages, an exciting
          general tenor, a moving and absorbing finale—so much of a work of
          art is accessible even to most laymen. In an art period when it is
          desired to win over the great majority of the laymen to the side of
          the artists and to make a party perhaps for the very preservation
          of art, the creative artist will do well to offer nothing more than
          the above. Then he will not be a squanderer of his strength, in
          spheres where no one is grateful to him. For to perform the
          remaining functions, the imitation of Nature in her organic
          development and growth, would in that case be like sowing seeds in
          water.</p>

<p><span><span>Becoming Great to the Detriment of History.</span></span>—Every later master who
          leads the taste of art-lovers into his channel unconsciously gives
          rise to a selection and revaluation of the older masters and their
          works. Whatever in them is conformable and akin to him, and
          anticipates and foreshadows him, appears henceforth as the only
          important element in them and their works—a fruit in which a great
          error usually lies hidden like a worm.</p>

          and thinkers to feel reverence for their defects, their
          intellectual poverty, their absurd infatuations and passions (as it
          is quite possible to do); if we show them only the lofty side of
          crime and folly, only the touching and appealing element in
          weakness and flabbiness and blind devotion (that too has often
          enough been done):—we have employed the means for inspiring even an
          unphilosophical and inartistic age with an ecstatic love of
          philosophy and art (especially of thinkers and artists as
          personalities) and, in the worst case, perhaps with the only means
          of defending the existence of such tender and fragile beings.</p>

<p><span><span>Criticism and Joy.</span></span>—Criticism, one-sided and unjust as well as
          intelligent criticism, gives so much pleasure to him who exercises
          it that the world is indebted to every work and every action that
          inspires much criticism and many critics. For criticism draws after
          it a glittering train of joyousness, wit, self-admiration, pride,
          instruction, designs of improvement.—The God of joy created the bad
          and the mediocre for the same reason that he created the good.</p>

<p><span><span>Beyond his Limits.</span></span>—When an artist wants to be more than an
          artist—for example, the moral awakener of his people—he at last
          falls in love, as a punishment, with a monster of moral substance.
          The Muse laughs, for, though a kind-hearted Goddess, she can also
          be malignant from jealousy. Milton and Klopstock are cases in

<span>151.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Glass Eye.</span></span>—The tendency of a talent towards moral subjects,
          characters, motives, towards the <span>“beautiful
          soul”</span> of the work of art, is often only a glass eye put on
          by the artist who lacks a beautiful soul. It may result, though
          rarely, that his eye finally becomes living Nature, if indeed it be
          Nature with a somewhat troubled look. But the ordinary result is
          that the whole world thinks it sees Nature where there is only cold
          glass.</p>

<span>152.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Writing and Desire for Victory.</span></span>—Writing should always indicate a
          victory, indeed a conquest of oneself which must be communicated to
          others for their behoof. There are, however, dyspeptic authors who
          only write when they cannot digest something, or when something has
          remained stuck in their teeth. Through their anger they try
          unconsciously to disgust the reader too, and to exercise violence
          upon him—that is, they desire victory, but victory over others.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>153.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Good Book Needs Time.</span></span>—Every good book tastes bitter when it
          first comes out, for it has the defect of newness. Moreover, it
          suffers damage from its living author, if he is well known and much
          talked about. For all the world is accustomed to confuse the author
          with his work. Whatever of profundity, sweetness, and brilliance
          the work may contain must be developed as the years go by,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg079"></a> under the care of
          growing, then old, and lastly traditional reverence. Many hours
          must pass, many a spider must have woven its web about the book. A
          book is made better by good readers and clearer by good
          opponents.</p>

<h2>
<span>154.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Extravagance as an Artistic Means.</span></span>—Artists well understand the idea
          of using extravagance as an artistic means in order to convey an
          impression of wealth. This is one of those innocent wiles of
          soul-seduction that the artist must know, for in his world, which
          has only appearance in view, the means to appearance need not
          necessarily be genuine.</p>

<span>155.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Hidden Barrel-Organ.</span></span>—Genius, by virtue of its more ample

          after all it too can only play its seven old pieces over and over
          again.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>156.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Name on the Title-Page.</span></span>—It is now a matter of custom and almost
          of duty for the author's name to appear on the book, and this is a
          main cause of the fact that books have so little influence. If they
          are good, they are worth more than the personalities of their
          authors, of which they are the quintessences. But as soon as the
          author makes himself known on the title-page, the quintessence,
          from the reader's point of view, becomes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg080"></a> diluted with the personal, the most personal
          element, and the aim of the book is frustrated. It is the ambition
          of the intellect no longer to appear individual.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>158.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Little or no Love.</span></span>—Every good book is written for a particular
          reader and men of his stamp, and for that very reason is looked
          upon unfavourably by all other readers, by the vast majority. Its
          reputation accordingly rests on a narrow basis and must be built up
          by degrees.—The mediocre and bad book is mediocre and bad because
          it seeks to please, and does please, a great number.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>159.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Music and Disease.</span></span>—The danger of the new music lies in the fact
          that it puts the cup of rapture and exaltation to the lips so
          invitingly, and with such a show of moral ecstasy, that even the
          noble and temperate man always drinks a drop too much. This minimum
          of intemperance, constantly repeated, can in the end bring about a
          deeper convulsion and destruction of mental health than any coarse
          excess could do. Hence nothing remains but some day to fly from the
          grotto of the nymph, and through perils and billowy seas to forge
          one's way to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg

<div>
<h2>
<span>161.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Youth and Criticism.</span></span>—To criticise a book means, for the young,
          not to let oneself be touched by a single productive thought
          therefrom, and to protect one's skin with hands and feet. The
          youngster lives in opposition to all novelty that he cannot love in
          the lump, in a position of self-defence, and in this connection he
          commits, as often as he can, a superfluous sin.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>162.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Effect of Quantity.</span></span>—The greatest paradox in the history of
          poetic art lies in this: that in all that constitutes the greatness
          of the old poets a man may be a barbarian, faulty and deformed from
          top to toe, and still remain the greatest of poets. This is the
          case with Shakespeare, who, as compared with Sophocles, is like a
          mine of immeasurable wealth in gold, lead, and rubble, whereas
          Sophocles is not merely gold, but gold in its noblest form, one
          that almost makes us forget the money-value of the metal. But
          quantity in its highest intensity has the same effect as quality.
          That is a good thing for Shakespeare.</p>

<h2>
<span>163.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>All Beginning is Dangerous.</span></span>—The Poet can choose whether to raise
          emotion from one grade to another, and so finally to exalt it to a
          great height—or to try a surprise attack, and from the start to
          pull the bell-rope with might and main. Both processes have their
          danger—in the first case his hearer may run away from him through
          boredom, in the second through terror.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>164.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>In Favour of Critics.</span></span>—Insects sting, not from malice, but because
          they too want to live. It is the same with our critics—they desire
          our blood, not our pain.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>165.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Success of Aphorisms.</span></span>—The inexperienced, when an aphorism at
          once illuminates their minds with its naked truth, always think
          that it is old and well known. They look askance at the author, as
          if he had wanted to steal the common property of all, whereas they
          enjoy highly spiced half-truths, and give the author to understand
          as much. He knows how to appreciate the hint, and easily guesses
          thereby where he has succeeded and failed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>166.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Desire for Victory.</span></span>—An artist who exceeds the limit of his
          strength in all that he undertakes will end by carrying the
          multitude along with him through the spectacle of violent
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg083"></a> wrestling that he
          affords. Success is not always the accompaniment only of victory,
          but also of the desire for victory.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>167.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Sibi Scribere.</span></span>—The sensible author writes for no
          other posterity than his own—that is, for his age—so as to be able
          even then to take pleasure in himself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>168.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Praise of the Aphorism.</span></span>—A good aphorism is too hard for the tooth
          of time, and is not worn away by all the centuries, although it
          serves as food for every epoch. Hence it is the greatest paradox in
          literature, the imperishable in the midst of change, the
          nourishment which always remains highly valued, as salt does, and
          never becomes stupid like salt.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>169.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Art-Need of the Second Order.</span></span>—The people may have something of
          what can be called art-need, but it is small, and can be cheaply
          satisfied. On the whole, the remnant of art (it must be honestly
          confessed) suffices for this need. Let us consider, for example,
          the kind of melodies and songs in which the most vigorous,
          unspoiled, and true-hearted classes of the population find genuine
          delight; let us live among shepherds, cowherds, peasants, huntsmen,
          soldiers, and sailors, and give ourselves the answer. And in the
          country town, just in the houses that are the homes of inherited
          civic virtue, is it not the worst music at present produced
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg084"></a> that is loved and,
          one might say, cherished? He who speaks of deeper needs and
          unsatisfied yearnings for art among the people, as it is, is a
          crank or an impostor. Be honest! Only in exceptional men is there
          now an art-need in the highest sense—because art is once more on
          the down-grade, and human powers and hopes are for the time being
          directed to other matters.—Apart from this, outside the populace,
          there exists indeed, in the higher and highest strata of society, a
          broader and more comprehensive art-need, but <em><span>of the second
          order</span></em>. Here there is a sort of artistic commune, which
          possibly means to be sincere. But let us look at the elements! They
          are in general the more refined malcontents, who attain no genuine
          pleasure in themselves; the cultured, who have not become free
          enough to dispense with the consolations of religion, and yet do
          not find its incense sufficiently fragrant; the half-aristocratic,
          who are too weak to combat by a heroic conversion or renunciation
          the one fundamental error of their lives or the pernicious bent of
          their characters; the highly gifted, who think themselves too
          dignified to be of service by modest activity, and are too lazy for
          real, self-sacrificing work; girls who cannot create for themselves
          a satisfactory sphere of duties; women who have tied themselves by
          a light-hearted or nefarious marriage, and know that they are not
          tied securely enough; scholars, physicians, merchants, officials
          who specialised too early and never gave their lives a free enough
          scope—who do their work efficiently, it is true, but with a worm
          gnawing at their hearts; finally, all imperfect artists—these are
          nowadays the true needers of art! <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a> What do they really desire from art? Art is
          to drive away hours and moments of discomfort, boredom, half-bad
          conscience, and, if possible, transform the faults of their lives
          and characters into faults of world-destiny. Very different were
          the Greeks, who realised in their art the outflow and overflow of
          their own sense of well-being and health, and loved to see their
          perfection once more from a standpoint outside themselves. They
          were led to art by delight in themselves; our contemporaries—by
          disgust of themselves.</p>

<p><span><span>The Germans in the Theatre.</span></span>—The real theatrical talent of the
          Germans was Kotzebue. He and his Germans, those of higher as well
          as those of middle-class society, were necessarily associated, and
          his contemporaries should have said of him in all seriousness,
          <span>“in him we live and move and have our
          being.”</span> Here was nothing—no constraint, pretence, or
          half-enjoyment: what he could and would do was understood. Yes,
          until now the honest theatrical success on the German stage has
          been in the hands of the shamefaced or unashamed heirs of
          Kotzebue's methods and influence—that is, as far as comedy still
          flourishes at all. The result is that much of the Germanism of that
          age, sometimes far off from the great towns, still survives.
          Good-natured; incontinent in small pleasures; always ready for
          tears; with the desire, in the theatre at any rate, to be able to
          get rid of their innate sobriety and strict attention to duty and
          exercise; a smiling, nay, a laughing indulgence; confusing goodness
          and sympathy and welding them into one, as is the essential
          characteristic of German sentimentality; exceedingly happy at a noble,
          magnanimous action; for the rest, submissive towards superiors,
          envious of each other, and yet in their heart of hearts thoroughly
          self-satisfied—such were they and such was he.—The second dramatic
          talent was Schiller. He discovered a class of hearers which had
          hitherto never been taken into consideration: among the callow
          German youth of both sexes. His poetry responded to their higher,
          nobler, more violent if more confused emotions, their delight in
          the jingle of moral words (a delight that begins to disappear when
          we reach the thirties). Thus he won for himself, by virtue of the
          passionateness and partisanship of the young, a success which
          gradually reacted with advantage upon those of riper years.
          Generally speaking, Schiller rejuvenated the Germans. Goethe stood
          and still stands above the Germans in every respect. To them he
          will never belong. How could a nation in well-being and
          well-wishing come up to the intellectuality of Goethe? Beethoven
          composed and Schopenhauer philosophised above the heads of the
          Germans, and it was above their heads, in the same way, that Goethe
          wrote his <span><span>Tasso</span></span>, his <span><span>Iphigenie</span></span>. He was followed by a
          small company of highly cultured persons, who were educated by
          antiquity, life, and travel, and had grown out of German ways of
          thought. He himself did not wish it to be otherwise.—When the
          Romantics set up their well-conceived Goethe cult; when their
          amazing skill in appreciation was passed on to the disciples of
          Hegel, the real educators of the Germans of this century; when the
          awakening national ambition turned out advantageous to the fame of
          the German poets; when the real standard of the nation, as to
          whether it could honestly find enjoyment in anything, became
          inexorably subordinated to the judgment of individuals and to that
          national ambition,—that is, when people began to enjoy by
          compulsion,—then arose that
          false, spurious German culture which was ashamed of Kotzebue; which
          brought Sophocles, Calderon, and even the Second Part of Goethe's
          <span><span>Faust</span></span> on the stage; and which,
          on account of its foul tongue and congested stomach, no longer
          knows now what it likes and what it finds tedious.—Happy are those
          who have taste, even if it be a bad taste! Only by this
          characteristic can one be wise as well as happy. Hence the Greeks,
          who were very refined in such matters, designated the sage by a
          word that means <span>“man of taste,”</span> and
          called wisdom, artistic as well as scientific, <span>“taste”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span>sophia</span></span>).</p>

<p><span><span>Music as a
          Late-Comer in every Culture.</span></span>—Among all the arts that
          are accustomed to grow on a definite culture-soil and under
          definite social and political conditions, music is the last plant
          to come up, arising in the autumn and fading-season of the culture
          to which it belongs. At the same time, the first signs and
          harbingers of a new spring are usually already noticeable, and
          sometimes music, like the language of a forgotten age, rings out
          into a new, astonished world, and comes too late. In the art of the
          Dutch and Flemish musicians the soul of the Christian middle ages at last found
          its fullest tone: their sound-architecture is the posthumous but
          legitimate and equal sister of Gothic. Not until Handel's music was
          heard the note of the best in the soul of Luther and his kin, the
          great Judæo-heroical impulse that created the whole Reformation
          movement. Mozart first expressed in golden melody the age of Louis
          <span><span>xiv.</span></span> and the art of Racine
          and Claude Lorrain. The eighteenth century—that century of
          rhapsody, of broken ideals and transitory happiness—only sang
          itself out in the music of Beethoven and Rossini. A lover of
          sentimental similes might say that all really important music was a
          swan-song.—Music is, in fact, not a universal language for all
          time, as is so often said in its praise, but responds exactly to a
          particular period and warmth of emotion which involves a quite
          definite, individual culture, determined by time and place, as its
          inner law. The music of Palestrina would be quite unintelligible to
          a Greek; and again, what would the music of Rossini convey to
          Palestrina?—It may be that our most modern German music, with all
          its pre-eminence and desire of pre-eminence, will soon be no longer
          understood. For this music sprang from a culture that is undergoing
          a rapid decay, from the soil of that epoch of reaction and
          restoration in which a certain Catholicism of feeling, as well as a
          delight in all indigenous, national, primitive manners, burst into
          bloom and scattered a blended perfume over Europe. These two
          emotional tendencies, adopted in their greatest strength and
          carried to their farthest limits, found final expression in the
          music of Wagner. Wagner's predilection for the old native sagas, his free idealisation of
          their unfamiliar gods and heroes,—who are really sovereign beasts
          of prey with occasional fits of thoughtfulness, magnanimity, and
          boredom,—his re-animation of those figures, to which he gave in
          addition the mediæval Christian thirst for ecstatic sensuality and
          spiritualisation—all this Wagnerian give-and-take with regard to
          materials, souls, figures, and words—would clearly express the
          spirit of his music, if it could not, like all music, speak quite
          unambiguously of itself. This spirit wages the last campaign of
          reaction against the spirit of illumination which passed into this
          century from the last, and also against the super-national ideas of
          French revolutionary romanticism and of English and American
          insipidity in the reconstruction of state and society.—But is it
          not evident that the spheres of thought and emotion apparently
          suppressed by Wagner and his school have long since acquired fresh
          strength, and that his late musical protest against them generally
          rings into ears that prefer to hear different and opposite notes;
          so that one day that high and wonderful art will suddenly become
          unintelligible and will be covered by the spider's web of oblivion?—In considering this state of affairs we must not let
          ourselves be led astray by those transitory fluctuations which
          arise like a reaction within a reaction, as a temporary sinking of
          the mountainous wave in the midst of the general upheaval. Thus,
          this decade of national war, ultramontane martyrdom, and
          socialistic unrest may, in its remoter after-effect, even aid the
          Wagnerian art to acquire a sudden halo, without guaranteeing that
          it <span>“has a future”</span> or that it
          has <em><span>the</span></em>
          future. It is in the very nature of music that the fruits of its
          great culture-vintage should lose their taste and wither earlier
          than the fruits of the plastic arts or those that grow on the tree
          of knowledge. Among all the products of the human artistic sense
          ideas are the most solid and lasting.</p>

<p><span><span>The Poet no
          longer a Teacher.</span></span>—Strange as it may sound to our
          time, there were once poets and artists whose soul was above the
          passions with their delights and convulsions, and who therefore
          took their pleasure in purer materials, worthier men, more delicate
          complications and dénouements. If the artists of our day for the
          most part unfetter the will, and so are under certain circumstances
          for that very reason emancipators of life, those were tamers of the
          will, enchanters of animals, creators of men. In fact, they
          moulded, re-moulded, and new-moulded life, whereas the fame of
          poets of our day lies in unharnessing, unchaining, and
          shattering.—The ancient Greeks demanded of the poet that he should
          be the teacher of grown men. How ashamed the poet would be now if
          this demand were made of him! He is not even a good student of
          himself, and so never himself becomes a good poem or a fine
          picture. Under the most favourable circumstances he remains the
          shy, attractive ruin of a temple, but at the same time a cavern of
          cravings, overgrown like a ruin with flowers, nettles, and
          poisonous weeds, inhabited and haunted by snakes, worms, spiders,
          and birds; an object for sad reflection as to why the noblest and
          most precious must grow up at once like a ruin, without the past and future of
          perfection.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>173.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Looking Forward
          and Backward.</span></span>—An art like that which streams out of
          Homer, Sophocles, Theocritus, Calderon, Racine, Goethe, as the
          superabundance of a wise and harmonious conduct of life—that is the
          true art, at which we grasp when we have ourselves become wiser and
          more harmonious. It is not that barbaric, if ever so delightful,
          outpouring of hot and highly coloured things from an undisciplined,
          chaotic soul, which is what we understood by <span>“art”</span> in our youth. It is obvious from the
          nature of the case that for certain periods of life an art of
          overstrain, excitement, antipathy to the orderly, monotonous,
          simple, logical, is an inevitable need, to which artists must
          respond, lest the soul of such periods should unburden itself in
          other ways, through all kinds of disorder and impropriety. Hence
          youths as they generally are, full, fermenting, tortured above all
          things by boredom, and women who lack work that fully occupies
          their soul, require that art of delightful disorder. All the more
          violently on that account are they inflamed with a desire for
          satisfaction without change, happiness without stupor and
          intoxication.</p>

<h2>
<span>174.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Against the Art
          of Works of Art.</span></span>—Art is above all and first of all
          meant to embellish life, to make us ourselves endurable and if
          possible agreeable in the eyes of others. With this task in view,
          art moderates us and
          holds us in restraint, creates forms of intercourse, binds over the
          uneducated to laws of decency, cleanliness, politeness, well-timed
          speech and silence. Hence art must conceal or transfigure
          everything that is ugly—the painful, terrible, and disgusting
          elements which in spite of every effort will always break out
          afresh in accordance with the very origin of human nature. Art has
          to perform this duty especially in regard to the passions and
          spiritual agonies and anxieties, and to cause the significant
          factor to shine through unavoidable or unconquerable ugliness. To
          this great, super-great task the so-called art proper, that of
          works of art, is a mere accessary. A man who feels within himself a
          surplus of such powers of embellishment, concealment, and
          transfiguration will finally seek to unburden himself of this
          surplus in works of art. The same holds good, under special
          circumstances, of a whole nation.—But as a rule we nowadays begin
          art at the end, hang on to its tail, and think that works of art
          constitute art proper, and that life should be improved and
          transformed by this means—fools that we are! If we begin a dinner
          with dessert, and try sweet after sweet, small wonder that we ruin
          our digestions and even our appetites for the good, hearty,
          nourishing meal to which art invites us!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>175.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Continued
          Existence of Art.</span></span>—Why, really, does a creative art
          nowadays continue to exist? Because the majority who have hours of
          leisure (and such an art is for them only) think that they cannot
          fill up their time without music, theatres and picture-galleries,
          novels and poetry. Granted that one could keep them from this
          indulgence, either they would strive less eagerly for leisure, and
          the invidious sight of the rich would be less common (a great gain
          for the stability of society), or they would have leisure, but
          would learn to reflect on
          what can be learnt and unlearnt: on their work, for instance, their
          associations, the pleasure they could bestow. All the world, with
          the exception of the artist, would in both cases reap the
          advantage.—Certainly, there are many vigorous, sensible readers who
          could take objection to this. Still, it must be said on behalf of
          the coarse and malignant that the author himself is concerned with
          this protest, and that there is in his book much to be read that is
          not actually written down therein.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>176.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Mouthpiece
          of the Gods.</span></span>—The poet expresses the universal higher
          opinions of the nation, he is its mouthpiece and flute; but by
          virtue of metre and all other artistic means he so expresses them
          that the nation regards them as something quite new and wonderful,
          and believes in all seriousness that he is the mouthpiece of the
          Gods. Yes, under the clouds of creation the poet himself forgets
          whence he derives all his intellectual wisdom—from father and
          mother, from teachers and books of all kinds, from the street and
          particularly from the priest. He is deceived by his own art, and
          really believes, in a naïve period, that a God is speaking through
          him, that he is creating in a state of religious inspiration. As a
          matter of fact, he is only saying what he has learnt, a medley of
          popular wisdom and popular foolishness. Hence, so far as a poet is
          really <span><span>vox populi</span></span> he is held to be
          <span><span>vox dei</span></span>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>177.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>What all Art
          wants to Do and Cannot.</span></span>—The last and hardest task of
          the artist is the presentment of what remains the same, reposes in
          itself, is lofty and simple and free from the bizarre. Hence the
          noblest forms of moral perfection are rejected as inartistic by
          weaker artists, because the sight of these fruits is too painful
          for their ambition. The fruit gleams at them from the topmost
          branches of art, but they lack the ladder, the courage, the grip to
          venture so high. In himself a Phidias is quite possible as a poet,
          but, if modern strength be taken into consideration, almost solely
          in the sense that to God nothing is impossible. The desire for a
          poetical Claude Lorrain is already an immodesty at present, however
          earnestly one man's heart may yearn for such a consummation.—The
          presentment of the highest man, the most simple and at the same
          time the most complete, has hitherto been beyond the scope of all
          artists. Perhaps, however, the Greeks, in the ideal of Athene, saw
          farther than any men did before or after their time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>178.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Art and
          Restoration.</span></span>—The retrograde movements in history, the
          so-called periods of restoration, which try to revive intellectual
          and social conditions that existed before those immediately
          preceding,—and seem really to succeed in giving them a brief
          resurrection,—have the charm of sentimental recollection, ardent
          longing for what is almost lost, hasty embracing of a transitory
          happiness. It is on account of this strange trend towards seriousness
          that in such
          transient and almost dreamy periods art and poetry find a natural
          soil, just as the tenderest and rarest plants grow on
          mountain-slopes of steep declivity.—Thus many a good artist is
          unwittingly impelled to a <span>“restoration”</span> way of thinking in politics and
          society, for which, on his own account, he prepares a quiet little
          corner and garden. Here he collects about himself the human remains
          of the historical epoch that appeals to him, and plays his lyre to
          many who are dead, half-dead, and weary to death, perhaps with the
          above-mentioned result of a brief resurrection.</p>

<h2>
<span>179.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Happiness of
          the Age.</span></span>—In two respects our age is to be accounted
          happy. With respect to the <em><span>past</span></em>, we enjoy all cultures and
          their productions, and nurture ourselves on the noblest blood of
          all periods. We stand sufficiently near to the magic of the forces
          from whose womb these periods are born to be able in passing to
          submit to their spell with pleasure and terror; whereas earlier
          cultures could only enjoy themselves, and never looked beyond
          themselves, but were rather overarched by a bell of broader or
          narrower dome, through which indeed light streamed down to them,
          but which their gaze could not pierce. With respect to the
          <em><span>future</span></em>, there opens out to us for the first time a
          mighty, comprehensive vista of human and economic purposes
          engirdling the whole inhabited globe. At the same time, we feel
          conscious of a power ourselves to take this new task in hand
          without presumption, without requiring supernatural aids. Yes,
          whatever the result of our enterprise, however much we may have
          overestimated our strength, at any rate we need render account to
          no one but ourselves, and mankind can henceforth begin to do with
          itself what it will.—There are, it is true, peculiar human bees,
          who only know how to suck the bitterest and worst elements from the
          chalice of every flower. It is true that all flowers contain
          something that is not honey, but these bees may be allowed to feel
          in their own way about the happiness of our time, and continue to
          build up their hive of discomfort.</p>

<p><span><span>A

          adults, even the most mature, and such institutions visited without
          compulsion but in accordance with the moral injunction of the whole
          community; the churches as the meeting-places most worthy and rich
          in memories for the purpose; at the same time daily festivals in
          honour of the reason that is attained and attainable by man; a
          newer and fuller budding and blooming of the ideal of the teacher,
          in which the clergyman, the artist and the physician, the man of
          science and the sage are blended, and their individual virtues
          should come to the fore as a collective virtue in their teaching itself,
          in their discourses, in their method—this is my ever-recurring
          vision, of which I firmly believe that it has raised a corner of
          the veil of the future.</p>

          whole system of education, which leads every adult to say nowadays
          that his sole educator was chance, and the weathercock-nature of
          educational methods and aims, may be explained as follows. The
          oldest and the newest culture-powers, as in a turbulent
          mass-meeting, would rather be heard than understood, and wish to
          prove at all costs by their outcries and clamourings that they
          still exist or already exist. The poor teachers and educators are
          first dazed by this senseless noise, then become silent and finally
          apathetic, allowing anything to be done to them just as they in
          their turn allow anything to be done to their pupils. They are not
          trained themselves, so how are they to train others? They are
          themselves no straight-growing, vigorous, succulent trees, and he
          who wishes to attach himself to them must wind and bend himself and
          finally become distorted and deformed as they.</p>

<p><span><span>Philosophers

          is to be found in the picture of the highest European society of
          the present day. There the artist thinks that he is achieving a great deal when
          through his art he lights the torch of the heart as well as the
          torch of desire. The philosopher has the same notion, when in the
          chilliness of his heart, which he has in common with his age, he
          cools hot desires in himself and his following by his world-denying
          judgments.</p>

<p><span><span>Not To Be a

          we must first do superior actions and secondly seek the superior
          wherever and under whatever names it is to be found; that we must
          at once go out of the way of all badness and mediocrity <em><span>without fighting
          it</span></em>; and that even doubt as to the excellence of a thing
          (such as quickly arises in one of practised taste) should rank as
          an argument against it and a reason for completely avoiding it. We
          must not shrink from the danger of occasionally making a mistake
          and confounding the less accessible good with the bad and
          imperfect. Only he who can do nothing better should attack the
          world's evils as the soldier of culture. But those who should
          support culture and spread its teachings ruin themselves if they go
          about armed, and by precautions, night-watches, and bad dreams turn
          the peace of their domestic and artistic life into sinister
          unrest.</p>

<p><span><span>How Natural
          History Should Be Expounded.</span></span>—Natural history, like
          the history of the war and victory of moral and intellectual forces in the campaign
          against anxiety, self-delusion, laziness, superstition, folly,
          should be so expounded that every reader or listener may be
          continually aroused to strive after mental and physical health and
          soundness, after the feeling of joy, and be awakened to the desire
          to be the heir and continuator of mankind, to an ever nobler
          adventurous impulse. Hitherto natural history has not found its
          true language, because the inventive and eloquent artists—who are
          needed for this purpose—never rid themselves of a secret mistrust
          of it, and above all never wish to learn from it a thorough lesson.
          Nevertheless it must be conceded to the English that their
          scientific manuals for the lower strata of the people have made
          admirable strides towards that ideal. But then such books are
          written by their foremost men of learning, full, complete, and
          inspiring natures, and not, as among us, by mediocre
          investigators.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>185.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Genius in
          Humanity.</span></span>—If genius, according to Schopenhauer's
          observation, lies in the coherent and vivid recollection of our own
          experience, a striving towards genius in humanity collectively
          might be deduced from the striving towards knowledge of the whole
          historic past—which is beginning to mark off the modern age more
          and more as compared with earlier ages and has for the first time
          broken down the barriers between nature and spirit, men and
          animals, morality and physics. A perfectly conceived history would
          be cosmic self-consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>186.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Cult of
          Culture.</span></span>—On great minds is bestowed the terrifying
          all-too-human of their natures, their blindnesses, deformities, and
          extravagances, so that their more powerful, easily all-too-powerful
          influence may be continually held within bounds through the
          distrust aroused by such qualities. For the sum-total of all that
          humanity needs for its continued existence is so comprehensive, and
          demands powers so diverse and so numerous, that for every one-sided
          predilection, whether in science or politics or art or commerce, to
          which such natures would persuade us, mankind as a whole has to pay
          a heavy price. It has always been a great disaster to culture when
          human beings are worshipped. In this sense we may understand the
          precept of Mosaic law which forbids us to have any other gods but
          God.—Side by side with the cult of genius and violence we must
          always place, as its complement and remedy, the cult of culture.
          This cult can find an intelligent appreciation even for the
          material, the inferior, the mean, the misunderstood, the weak, the
          imperfect, the one-sided, the incomplete, the untrue, the apparent,
          even the wicked and horrible, and can grant them the concession
          that <em><span>all
          this is necessary</span></em>. For the continued harmony of all
          things human, attained by amazing toil and strokes of luck, and
          just as much the work of Cyclopes and ants as of geniuses, shall
          never be lost. How, indeed, could we dispense with that deep,
          universal, and often uncanny bass, without which, after all, melody cannot
          be melody?</p>

<p><span><span>The Antique
          World and Pleasure.</span></span>—The man of the antique world
          understood better how to rejoice, we understand better how to
          grieve less. They continually found new motives for feeling happy,
          for celebrating festivals, being inventive with all their wealth of
          shrewdness and reflection. We, on the other hand, concentrate our
          intellect rather on the solving of problems which have in view
          painlessness and the removal of sources of discomfort. With regard
          to suffering existence, the ancients sought to forget or in some
          way to convert the sensation into a pleasant one, thus trying to
          supply palliatives. We attack the causes of suffering, and on the
          whole prefer to use prophylactics.—Perhaps we are only building
          upon a foundation whereon a later age will once more set up the
          temple of joy.</p>

<p><span><span>How Paradoxical
          Homer can be.</span></span>—Is there anything more desperate, more
          horrible, more incredible, shining over human destiny like a winter
          sun, than that idea of Homer's:</p>
<p><span>“So the decree of the Gods willed it, and doomed man to
          perish, that it might be a matter for song even to distant
          generations”</span>?</p>
<p>In other words,
          we suffer and perish so that poets may not lack material, and this
          is the dispensation of those very Gods of Homer who seem much
          concerned about the joyousness of generations to come, but very
          little about us men of the present. To think that such ideas should

          himself a great man.</p>
</div>
<div>

<span>192.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Injustice of
          Genius.</span></span>—Genius is most unjust towards geniuses, if
          they be contemporary. Either it thinks it has no need of them and
          considers them superfluous (for it can do without them), or their
          influence crosses the path of its electric current, in which case
          it even calls them pernicious.</p>

<p><span><span>Three Thinkers
          like one Spider.</span></span>—In every philosophical school three
          thinkers follow one another in this relation: the first produces
          from himself sap and seed, the second draws it out in threads and
          spins a cunning web, the third waits in this web for the victims
          who are caught in it—and tries to live upon this philosophy.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>195.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>From
          Association with Authors.</span></span>—It is as bad a habit to go

          the horn (and every author has his horn).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>196.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Team of
          Two.</span></span>—Vagueness of thought and outbursts of
          sentimentality are as often wedded to the reckless desire to have
          one's own way by hook or by crook, to make oneself alone of any
          consequence, as a genuinely helpful, gracious, and kindly spirit is
          wedded to the impulse towards clearness and purity of thought and towards emotional
          moderation and self-restraint.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>197.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Binding and
          Separating Forces.</span></span>—Surely it is in the heads of men
          that there arises the force that binds them—an understanding of
          their common interest or the reverse; and in their hearts the force
          that separates them—a blind choosing and groping in love and hate,
          a devotion to one at the expense of all, and a consequent contempt
          for the common utility.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>198.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Marksmen and
          Thinkers.</span></span>—There are curious marksmen who miss their
          mark, but leave the shooting-gallery with secret pride in the fact
          that their bullet at any rate flew very far (beyond the mark, it is
          true), or that it did not hit the mark but hit something else.
          There are thinkers of the same stamp.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>199.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Attack from Two
          Sides.</span></span>—We act as enemies towards an intellectual
          tendency or movement when we are superior to it and disapprove of
          its aim, or when its aim is too high and unrecognisable to our
          eye—in other words, when it is superior to us. So the same party
          may be attacked from two sides, from above and from below. Not
          infrequently the assailants, from common hatred, form an alliance
          which is more repulsive than all that they hate.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>200.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Original.</span></span>—Original minds
          are distinguished not by being the first to see a new thing, but by
          seeing the old, well-known thing, which is seen and overlooked by
          every one, as something new. The first discoverer is usually that
          quite ordinary and unintellectual visionary—chance.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>201.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Error of
          Philosophers.</span></span>—The philosopher believes that the value
          of his philosophy lies in the whole, in the structure. Posterity
          finds it in the stone with which he built and with which, from that
          time forth, men will build oftener and better—in other words, in
          the fact that the structure may be destroyed and yet have value as
          material.</p>

          every hour that a man, immediately before the solution, remains
          stuck, being convinced that his efforts have been entirely in
          vain—like one who, in untying a noose, hesitates at the moment when
          it is nearest to coming loose, because at that very moment it looks

<p><span><span>Among the

          of his intelligence, may profitably consort with visionaries for a
          decade and abandon himself in their torrid zone to a moderate
          insanity. He will thus have travelled a good part of the road
          towards that cosmopolitanism of the intellect which can say without
          presumption, <span>“Nothing intellectual is alien to me.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>205.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Keen
          Air.</span></span>—The best and healthiest element in science as
          amid the mountains is the keen air that plays about
          it.—Intellectual molly-coddles (such as artists) dread and abuse
          science on account of this atmosphere.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>206.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Why Savants are
          Nobler than Artists.</span></span>—Science requires nobler natures
          than does poetry; natures that are more simple, less ambitious,
          more restrained, calmer, that think less of posthumous fame and can
          bury themselves in studies which, in the eye of the many, scarcely
          seem worthy of such a sacrifice of personality. There is another
          loss of which they are conscious. The nature of their occupation,
          its continual exaction of the greatest sobriety, weakens their
          will; the fire is not kept up so vigorously as on the hearths of
          poetic minds. As such, they often lose their strength and prime
          earlier than artists do—and, as has been said, they are aware of
          their danger. Under all circumstances they seem less gifted because
          they shine less, and thus they will always be rated below their
          value.</p>

<span>207.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>How Far Piety
          Obscures.</span></span>—In later centuries the great man is
          credited with all the great qualities and virtues of his century.
          Thus all that is best is continually obscured by piety, which
          treats the picture as a sacred one, to be surrounded with all
          manner of votive offerings. In the end the picture is completely
          veiled and covered by the offerings, and thenceforth is more an
          object of faith than of contemplation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>208.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Standing on
          One's Head.</span></span>—If we make truth stand on its head, we
          generally fail to notice that our own head, too, is not in its
          right position.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>209.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Origin and
          Utility of Fashion.</span></span>—The obvious satisfaction of the
          individual with his own form excites imitation and gradually
          creates the form of the many—that is, fashion. The many desire, and
          indeed attain, that same comforting satisfaction with their own
          form. Consider how many reasons every man has for anxiety and shy
          self-concealment, and how, on this account, three-fourths of his
          energy and goodwill is crippled and may become unproductive! So we
          must be very grateful to fashion for unfettering that three-fourths
          and communicating self-confidence and the power of cheerful
          compromise to those who feel themselves bound to each other by its
          law. Even foolish laws give freedom and calm of the spirit, so long as many
          persons have submitted to their sway.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>210.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Looseners of
          Tongues.</span></span>—The value of many men and books rests solely
          on their faculty for compelling all to speak out the most hidden
          and intimate things. They are looseners of tongues and crowbars to
          open the most stubborn teeth. Many events and misdeeds which are
          apparently only sent as a curse to mankind possess this value and
          utility.</p>

<div>
<h2>

<p><span><span>Intellectual

          spirit”</span> if he could not render homage after his fashion, by
          taking on his own shoulders a portion of that burden of public
          dislike and abuse, to men to whom this name is attached as a
          reproach? We might as well call ourselves in all seriousness
          <span>“spirits free of domicile”</span>
          (<span><span>Freizügig</span></span>) (and without that
          arrogant or high-spirited defiance) because we feel the impulse to
          freedom (<span><span>Zug zur
          Freiheit</span></span>) as the strongest instinct of our minds and,
          in contrast to fixed and limited minds, practically see our ideal
          in an intellectual nomadism—to use a modest and almost depreciatory
          expression.</p>

<p><span><span>Yes, the Favour

          right to our heart, so true, so terrible is it:</p>
<p><span>“The Muse loved him with all her heart and gave him
          good and evil, for she took away his eyes and vouchsafed him sweet
          song.”</span></p>
<p>This is an
          endless text for thinking men: she gives good and evil, that is
          <em><span>her</span></em> manner of loving with all her
          heart and soul! And each man will interpret specially for himself
          why we poets and thinkers have to give up our eyes in her
          service.</p>

<div>

<span>213.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Against the

          eye from childhood upwards by means of drawing, painting,
          landscape-sketching, figures, scenes, involves an estimable gain in
          life, making the eyesight keen, calm, and enduring in the
          observation of men and circumstances. No similar secondary
          advantage arises from the artistic cultivation of the ear, whence
          public schools will generally do well to give the art of the eye a
          preference over that of the ear.</p>

<p><span><span>The Discoverers

          farther than trivialities, often discover a triviality after taking
          all manner of circuitous routes and mountain paths, and, to the astonishment of
          the non-subtle, rejoice exceedingly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>215.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Morals of
          Savants.</span></span>—A regular and rapid advance in the sciences
          is only possible when the individual is compelled to be not so
          distrustful as to test every calculation and assertion of others,
          in fields which are remote from his own. A necessary condition,
          however, is that every man should have competitors in his own
          sphere, who are extremely distrustful and keep a sharp eye upon
          him. From this juxtaposition of <span>“not too
          distrustful”</span> and <span>“extremely
          distrustful”</span> arises sincerity in the republic of
          learning.</p>

<span>216.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Reasons for

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>217.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Perverted
          World of Tears.</span></span>—The manifold discomforts which the
          demands of higher culture cause to man finally pervert his nature
          to such an extent that he usually keeps himself stoical and
          unbending. Thus he has tears in reserve only for rare occasions of
          happiness, so that many must weep even at the enjoyment of
          painlessness—only when happy does his heart still beat.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>218.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Greeks as
          Interpreters.</span></span>—When we speak of the Greeks we
          unwittingly speak of to-day and yesterday; their universally known
          history is a blank mirror, always reflecting something that is not
          in the mirror itself. We enjoy the freedom of speaking about them
          in order to have the right of being silent about others—so that
          these Greeks themselves may whisper something in the ear of the
          reflective reader. Thus the Greeks facilitate to modern men the
          communication of much that is debatable and hard to
          communicate.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>219.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Of the Acquired
          Character of the Greeks.</span></span>—We are easily led astray by
          the renowned Greek clearness, transparency, simplicity, and order,
          by their crystal-like naturalness and crystal-like art, into
          believing that all these gifts were bestowed on the Greeks—for
          instance, that they could not but write well, as Lichtenberg
          expressed it on one occasion. Yet no statement could be more hasty
          and more untenable. The history of prose from Gorgias to
          Demosthenes shows a course of toiling and wrestling towards light
          from the obscure, overloaded, and tasteless, reminding one of the
          labour of heroes who had to construct the first roads through
          forest and bog. The dialogue of tragedy was the real achievement of
          the dramatist, owing to its uncommon clearness and precision,
          whereas the national tendency was to riot in symbolism and
          innuendo, a tendency expressly fostered by the great choral
          lyric. Similarly it
          was the achievement of Homer to liberate the Greeks from Asiatic
          pomp and gloom, and to have attained the clearness of architecture
          in details great and small. Nor was it by any means thought easy to
          say anything in a pure and illuminating style. How else should we
          account for the great admiration for the epigram of Simonides,
          which shows itself so simple, with no gilded points or arabesques
          of wit, but says all that it has to say plainly and with the calm
          of the sun, not with the straining after effect of the lightning.
          Since the struggle towards light from an almost native twilight is
          Greek, a thrill of jubilation runs through the people when they
          hear a laconic sentence, the language of elegy or the maxims of the
          Seven Wise Men. Hence they were so fond of giving precepts in
          verse, a practice that we find objectionable. This was the true
          Apolline task of the Hellenic spirit, with the aim of rising
          superior to the perils of metre and the obscurity which is
          otherwise characteristic of poetry. Simplicity, flexibility, and
          sobriety were wrestled for and not given by nature to this people.
          The danger of a relapse into Asianism constantly hovered over the
          Greeks, and really overtook them from time to time like a murky,
          overflowing tide of mystical impulses, primitive savagery and
          darkness. We see them plunge in; we see Europe, as it were,
          flooded, washed away—for Europe was very small then; but they
          always emerge once more to the light, good swimmers and divers that
          they are, those fellow-countrymen of Odysseus.</p>

<p><span><span>The Pagan
          Characteristic.</span></span>—Perhaps there is nothing more
          astonishing to the observer of the Greek world than to discover
          that the Greeks from time to time held festivals, as it were, for
          all their passions and evil tendencies alike, and in fact even
          established a kind of series of festivals, by order of the State,
          for their <span>“all-too-human.”</span> This is
          the pagan characteristic of their world, which Christianity has
          never understood and never can understand, and has always combated
          and despised.—They accepted this all-too-human as unavoidable, and
          preferred, instead of railing at it, to give it a kind of secondary
          right by grafting it on to the usages of society and religion. All
          in man that has power they called divine, and wrote it on the walls
          of their heaven. They do not deny this natural instinct that
          expresses itself in evil characteristics, but regulate and limit it
          to definite cults and days, so as to turn those turbulent streams
          into as harmless a course as possible, after devising sufficient
          precautionary measures. That is the root of all the moral
          broad-mindedness of antiquity. To the wicked, the dubious, the
          backward, the animal element, as to the barbaric, pre-Hellenic and
          Asiatic, which still lived in the depths of Greek nature, they
          allowed a moderate outflow, and did not strive to destroy it
          utterly. The whole system was under the domain of the State, which
          was built up not on individuals or castes, but on common human
          qualities. In the structure of the State the Greeks show that
          wonderful sense for typical facts which later on enabled them to
          become investigators of Nature, historians, geographers, and philosophers. It was
          not a limited moral law of priests or castes, which had to decide
          about the constitution of the State and State worship, but the most
          comprehensive view of the reality of all that is human. Whence do
          the Greeks derive this freedom, this sense of reality? Perhaps from
          Homer and the poets who preceded him. For just those poets whose
          nature is generally not the most wise or just possess, in
          compensation, that delight in reality and activity of every kind,
          and prefer not to deny even evil. It suffices for them if evil
          moderates itself, does not kill or inwardly poison everything—in
          other words, they have similar ideas to those of the founders of
          Greek constitutions, and were their teachers and forerunners.</p>

<p><span><span>Exceptional
          Greeks.</span></span>—In Greece, deep, thorough, serious minds were
          the exception. The national instinct tended rather to regard the
          serious and thorough as a kind of grimace. To borrow forms from a
          foreign source, not to create but to transform into the fairest
          shapes—that is Greek. To imitate, not for utility but for artistic
          illusion, ever and anon to gain the mastery over forced
          seriousness, to arrange, beautify, simplify—that is the continual
          task from Homer to the Sophists of the third and fourth centuries
          of our era, who are all outward show, pompous speech, declamatory
          gestures, and address themselves to shallow souls that care only
          for appearance, sound, and effect. And now let us estimate the
          greatness of those exceptional Greeks, who created science! Whoever
          tells of them, tells the most heroic story of the human mind!</p>

<p><span><span>Simplicity not
          the First nor the Last Thing in Point of Time.</span></span>—In the
          history of religious ideas many errors about development and false
          gradations are made in matters which in reality are not consecutive
          outgrowths but contemporary yet separate phenomena. In particular,
          simplicity has still far too much the reputation of being the
          oldest, the initial thing. Much that is human arises by subtraction
          and division, and not merely by doubling, addition, and
          unification.—For instance, men still believe in a gradual
          development of the idea of God from those unwieldy stones and
          blocks of wood up to the highest forms of anthropomorphism. Yet the
          fact is that so long as divinity was attributed to and felt in
          trees, logs of wood, stones, and beasts, people shrank from
          humanising their forms as from an act of godlessness. First of all,
          poets, apart from all considerations of cult and the ban of
          religious shame, have had to make the inner imagination of man
          accustomed and compliant to this notion. Wherever more pious
          periods and phases of thought gained the upper hand, this
          liberating influence of poets fell into the background, and
          sanctity remained, after as before, on the side of the monstrous,
          uncanny, quite peculiarly inhuman. And then, much of what the inner
          imagination ventures to picture to itself would exert a painful
          influence if externally and corporeally represented. The inner eye
          is far bolder and more shameless than the outer (whence the
          well-known difficulty and, to some extent, impossibility, of
          working epic material into dramatic form). The religious imagination for a long
          time entirely refuses to believe in the identity of God with an
          image: the image is meant to fix the numen of the Deity, actually and
          specifically, although in a mysterious and not altogether
          intelligible way. The oldest image of the Gods is meant to shelter
          and at the same time to hide the
          God—to indicate him but not to expose him to view. No Greek really
          looked upon his Apollo as a pointed pillar of wood, his Eros as a
          lump of stone. These were symbols, which were intended to inspire
          dread of the manifestation of the God. It was the same with those
          blocks of wood out of which individual limbs, generally in
          excessive number, were fashioned with the scantiest of carving—as,
          for instance, a Laconian Apollo with four hands and four ears. In
          the incomplete, symbolical, or excessive lies a terrible sanctity,
          which is meant to prevent us from thinking of anything human or
          similar to humanity. It is not an embryonic stage of art in which
          such things are made—as if they were not <em><span>able</span></em> to
          speak more plainly and portray more sensibly in the age when such
          images were honoured! Rather, men are afraid of just one
          thing—direct speaking out. Just as the cella hides and conceals in
          a mysterious twilight, yet not completely, the holy of holies, the
          real numen of the Deity; just as,
          again, the peripteric temple hides the cella, protecting it from
          indiscreet eyes as with a screen and a veil, yet not completely—so
          it is with the image of the Deity, and at the same time the
          concealment of the Deity.
          Only when outside the cult, in the profane world of
          athletic contest, the joy in the victor had risen so high that the
          ripples thus started reacted upon the lake of religious emotion,
          was the statue of the victor set up before the temple. Then the
          pious pilgrim had to accustom his eye and his soul, whether he
          would or no, to the inevitable sight of human beauty and
          super-strength, so that the worship of men and Gods melted into
          each other from physical and spiritual contact. Then too for the
          first time the fear of really humanising the figures of the Gods is
          lost, and the mighty arena for great plastic art is opened—even now
          with the limitation that wherever there is to be adoration the
          primitive form and ugliness are carefully preserved and copied. But
          the Hellene, as he dedicates and makes offerings, may now with
          religious sanction indulge in his delight in making God become a
          man.</p>

<p><span><span>Whither We must
          Travel.</span></span>—Immediate self-observation is not enough, by
          a long way, to enable us to learn to know ourselves. We need
          history, for the past continues to flow through us in a hundred
          channels. We ourselves are, after all, nothing but our own
          sensation at every moment of this continued flow. Even here, when
          we wish to step down into the stream of our apparently most
          peculiar and personal development, Heraclitus' aphorism,
          <span>“You cannot step twice into the same
          river,”</span> holds good.—This is a piece of wisdom which has,
          indeed, gradually become trite, but nevertheless has remained as
          strong and true as it ever was. It is the same with the saying that, in order to
          understand history, we must scrutinise the living remains of
          historical periods; that we must travel, as old Herodotus
          travelled, to other nations, especially to those so-called savage
          or half-savage races in regions where man has doffed or not yet
          donned European garb. For they are ancient and firmly established
          steps of culture on which we can stand. There is, however, a more
          subtle art and aim in travelling, which does not always necessitate
          our passing from place to place and going thousands of miles away.
          Very probably the last three centuries, in all their colourings and
          refractions of culture, survive even in our vicinity, only they
          have to be discovered. In some families, or even in individuals,
          the strata are still superimposed on each other, beautifully and
          perceptibly; in other places there are dispersions and
          displacements of the structure which are harder to understand.
          Certainly in remote districts, in less known mountain valleys,
          circumscribed communities have been able more easily to maintain an
          admirable pattern of a far older sentiment, a pattern that must
          here be investigated. On the other hand, it is improbable that such
          discoveries will be made in Berlin, where man comes into the world
          washed-out and sapless. He who after long practice of this art of
          travel has become a hundred-eyed Argus will accompany his Io—I mean
          his ego—everywhere, and in Egypt and Greece, Byzantium and Rome,
          France and Germany, in the age of wandering or settled races, in
          Renaissance or Reformation, at home and abroad, in sea, forest,
          plant, and mountain, will again light upon the travel-adventure of this
          ever-growing, ever-altered ego.—Thus self-knowledge becomes
          universal knowledge as regards the entire past, and, by another
          chain of observation, which can only be indicated here,
          self-direction and self-training in the freest and most far-seeing
          spirits might become universal direction as regards all future
          humanity.</p>

<h2>
<span>224.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Balm and
          Poison.</span></span>—We cannot ponder too deeply on this fact:
          Christianity is the religion of antiquity grown old; it presupposes
          degenerate old culture-stocks, and on them it had, and still has,
          power to work like balm. There are periods when ears and eyes are
          full of slime, so that they can no longer hear the voice of reason
          and philosophy or see the wisdom that walks in bodily shape,
          whether it bears the name of Epictetus or of Epicurus. Then,
          perhaps, the erection of the martyr's cross and the <span>“trumpet of the last judgment”</span> may have the
          effect of still inspiring such races to end their lives decently.
          If we think of Juvenal's Rome, of that poisonous toad with the eyes
          of Venus, we understand what it means to make the sign of the Cross
          before the world, we honour the silent Christian community and are
          grateful for its having stifled the Greco-Roman Empire. If, indeed,
          most men were then born in spiritual slavery, with the sensuality
          of old men, what a pleasure to meet beings who were more soul than
          body, and who seemed to realise the Greek idea of the shades of the
          under-world—shy, scurrying, chirping, kindly creatures, with a
          reversion on the <span>“better life,”</span> and therefore
          so unassuming, so secretly scornful, so proudly patient!—This
          Christianity, as the evening chime of the <em><span>good</span></em>
          antiquity, with cracked, weary and yet melodious bell, is balm in
          the ears even to one who only now traverses those centuries
          historically. What must it have been to those men themselves!—To
          young and fresh barbarian nations, on the other hand, Christianity
          is a poison. For to implant the teaching of sinfulness and
          damnation in the heroic, childlike, and animal soul of the old
          Germans is nothing but poisoning. An enormous chemical fermentation
          and decomposition, a medley of sentiments and judgments, a rank
          growth of adventurous legend, and hence in the long run a
          fundamental weakening of such barbarian peoples, was the inevitable
          result. True, without this weakening what should we have left of
          Greek culture, of the whole cultured past of the human race? For
          the barbarians untouched by Christianity knew very well how to make
          a clean sweep of old cultures, as was only too clearly shown by the
          heathen conquerors of Romanised Britain. Thus Christianity, against
          its will, was compelled to aid in making <span>“the antique world”</span> immortal.—There remains,
          however, a counter-question and the possibility of a
          counter-reckoning. Without this weakening through the poisoning
          referred to, would any of those fresh stocks—the Germans, for
          instance—have been in a position gradually to find by themselves a
          higher, a peculiar, a new culture, of which the most distant
          conception would therefore have been lost to humanity?—In this, as
          in every case, we do not know, Christianly speaking, whether God
          owes the devil or the devil God more thanks for everything having turned out
          as it has.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>225.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Faith makes
          Holy and Condemns.</span></span>—A Christian who happened upon
          forbidden paths of thought might well ask himself on some occasion
          whether it is really necessary that there should be a God, side by
          side with a representative Lamb, if faith in the existence of these
          beings suffices to produce the same influences? If they do exist
          after all, are they not superfluous beings? For all that is given
          by the Christian religion to the human soul, all that is
          beneficent, consoling, and edifying, just as much as all that
          depresses and crushes, emanates from that faith and not from the
          objects of that faith. It is here as in another well-known
          case—there were indeed no witches, but the terrible effects of the
          belief in witches were the same as if they really had existed. For
          all occasions where the Christian awaits the immediate intervention
          of a God, though in vain (for there is no God), his religion is
          inventive enough to find subterfuges and reasons for tranquillity.
          In so far Christianity is an ingenious religion.—Faith, indeed, has
          up to the present not been able to move real mountains, although I
          do not know who assumed that it could. But it can put mountains
          where there are none.</p>

<p><span><span>The
          Tragi-Comedy of Regensburg.</span></span>—Here and there we see
          with terrible clearness the harlequinade of Fortune, how she
          fastens the rope, on which she wills that succeeding centuries should dance, on to a few
          days, one place, the condition and opinions of one brain. Thus the
          fate of modern German history lies in the days of that disputation
          at Regensburg: the peaceful settlement of ecclesiastical and moral
          affairs, without religious wars or a counter-reformation, and also
          the unity of the German nation, seemed assured: the deep, gentle
          spirit of Contarini hovered for one moment over the theological
          squabble, victorious, as representative of the riper Italian piety,
          reflecting the morning glory of intellectual freedom. But Luther's
          hard head, full of suspicions and strange misgivings, showed
          resistance. Because justification by grace appeared to him
          <em><span>his</span></em> greatest motto and discovery,
          he did not believe the phrase in the mouth of Italians; whereas, in
          point of fact, as is well known, they had invented it much earlier
          and spread it throughout Italy in deep silence. In this apparent
          agreement Luther saw the tricks of the devil, and hindered the work
          of peace as well as he could, thereby advancing to a great extent
          the aims of the Empire's foes.—And now, in order to have a still
          stronger idea of the dreadful farcicality of it all, let us add
          that none of the principles about which men then disputed in
          Regensburg—neither that of original sin, nor that of redemption by
          proxy, nor that of justification by faith—is in any way true or
          even has any connection with truth: that they are now all
          recognised as incapable of being discussed. Yet on this account the
          world was set on fire—that is to say, by opinions which correspond
          to no things or realities; whereas as regards purely philological
          questions—as, for instance, that of the sacramental words in the
          Eucharist—discussion at any rate is permitted, because in this case
          the truth can be said. But <span>“where nothing
          is, even truth has lost her right.”</span>—Lastly,
          it only remains to be said that it is true these principles give
          rise to sources of power so mighty that without them all the mills
          of the modern world could not be driven with such force. And it is
          primarily a matter of force, only secondarily of truth (and perhaps
          not even secondarily)—is it not so, my dear up-to-date friends?</p>

<h2>
<span>227.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Goethe's
          Errors.</span></span>—Goethe is a signal exception among great
          artists in that he did not live within the limited confines of his
          real capacity, as if that must be the essential, the distinctive,
          the unconditional, and the last thing in him and for all the world.
          Twice he intended to possess something higher than he really
          possessed—and went astray in the second half of his life, where he
          seems quite convinced that he is one of the great scientific
          discoverers and illuminators. So too in the first half of his life
          he demanded of himself something higher than the poetic art seemed
          to him—and here already he made a mistake. That nature wished to
          make him a plastic artist,—<em><span>this</span></em> was his inwardly glowing and
          scorching secret, which finally drove him to Italy, that he might
          give vent to his mania in this direction and make to it every
          possible sacrifice. At last, shrewd as he was, and honestly averse
          to any mental
          perversion in himself, he discovered that a tricksy elf of desire
          had attracted him to the belief in this calling, and that he must
          free himself of the greatest passion of his heart and bid it
          farewell. The painful conviction, tearing and gnawing at his
          vitals, that it was necessary to bid farewell, finds full
          expression in the character of Tasso. Over Tasso, that Werther
          intensified, hovers the premonition of something worse than death,
          as when one says: <span>“Now it is over, after
          this farewell: how shall I go on living without going mad?”</span>
          These two fundamental errors of his life gave Goethe, in face of a
          purely literary attitude towards poetry (the only attitude then
          known to the world), such an unembarrassed and apparently almost
          arbitrary position. Not to speak of the period when Schiller (poor
          Schiller, who had no time himself and left no time to others) drove
          away his shy dread of poetry, his fear of all literary life and
          craftsmanship, Goethe appears like a Greek who now and then visits
          his beloved, doubting whether she be not a Goddess to whom he can
          give no proper name. In all his poetry one notices the inspiring
          neighbourhood of plastic art and Nature. The features of these
          figures that floated before him—and perhaps he always thought he
          was on the track of the metamorphoses of one Goddess—became,
          without his will or knowledge, the features of all the children of
          his art. Without the extravagances of error he would not have been
          Goethe—that is, the only German artist in writing who has not yet
          become out of date—just because he desired as little to be a writer
          as a German by vocation.</p>

<p><span><span>Travellers and

          are seen—they become really travelled and are, as it were, blind.
          Next come those who really see the world. The third class
          experience the results of their seeing. The fourth weave their
          experience into their life and carry it with them henceforth.
          Lastly, there are some men of the highest strength who, as soon as
          they have returned home, must finally and necessarily work out in
          their lives and productions all the things seen that they have
          experienced and incorporated in themselves.—Like these five species
          of travellers, all mankind goes through the whole pilgrimage of
          life, the lowest as purely passive, the highest as those who act
          and live out their lives without keeping back any residue of inner
          experiences.</p>

<span>229.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>In Climbing
          Higher.</span></span>—So soon as we climb higher than those who
          hitherto admired us, we appear to them as sunken and fallen. For
          they imagined that under all circumstances they were on the heights
          in our company (maybe also through our agency).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>230.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Measure and
          Moderation.</span></span>—Of two quite lofty things, measure and
          moderation, it is best never to speak. A few know their force and
          significance, from the mysterious paths of inner experiences and conversions:
          they honour in them something quite godlike, and are afraid to
          speak aloud. All the rest hardly listen when they are spoken about,
          and think the subjects under discussion are tedium and mediocrity.
          We must perhaps except those who have once heard a warning note
          from that realm but have stopped their ears against the sound. The
          recollection of it makes them angry and exasperated.</p>

<h2>
<span>231.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Humanity of
          Friendship and Comradeship.</span></span>—<span>“If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the
          right,”</span> that feeling is the hall-mark of humanity in intimate intercourse, and
          without that feeling every friendship, every band of apostles or
          disciples, sooner or later becomes a fraud.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>232.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The
          Profound.</span></span>—Men of profound thought appear to
          themselves in intercourse with others like comedians, for in order
          to be understood they must always simulate superficiality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>233.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>For the
          Scorners of</span> <span><span>“</span><span>Herd-Humanity.</span><span>”</span></span></span>—He who regards
          human beings as a herd, and flies from them as fast as he can, will
          certainly be caught up by them and gored upon their horns.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>234.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Main
          Transgression against the Vain.</span></span>—In society, he who
          gives another an opportunity of favourably setting forth his
          knowledge, sentiments, and experience sets himself above him.
          Unless he is felt by the other to be a superior being without
          limitation, he is guilty of an attack upon his vanity, while what
          he aimed at was the gratification of the other man's vanity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>235.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Disappointment.</span></span>—When a
          long life of action distinguished by speeches and writings gives
          publicity to a man's personality, personal intercourse with him is
          generally disappointing on two grounds. Firstly, one expects too
          much from a brief period of intercourse (namely, all that the
          thousand and one opportunities of life can alone bring out).
          Secondly, no recognised person gives himself the trouble to woo
          recognition in individual cases. He is too careless, and we are at
          too high a tension.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>236.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Two Sources of
          Kindness.</span></span>—To treat all men with equal good-humour,
          and to be kind without distinction of persons, may arise as much
          from a profound contempt for mankind as from an ingrained love of
          humanity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>237.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Wanderer in
          the Mountains to Himself.</span></span>—There are certain signs
          that you have gone farther and higher. There is a freer, wider prospect before you,
          the air blows cooler yet milder in your face (you have unlearned
          the folly of confounding mildness with warmth), your gait is more
          firm and vigorous, courage and discretion have waxed together. On
          all these grounds your journey may now be more lonely and in any
          case more perilous than heretofore, if indeed not to the extent
          believed by those who from the misty valley see you, the roamer,
          striding on the mountains.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>238.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>With the
          Exception of Our Neighbour.</span></span>—I admit that my head is
          set wrong on my neck only, for every other man, as is well known,
          knows better than I what I should do or leave alone. The only one
          who cannot help me is myself, poor beggar! Are we not all like
          statues on which false heads have been placed? Eh, dear
          neighbour?—Ah no; you, just you, are the exception!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>239.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Caution.</span></span>—We must either
          not go about at all with people who are lacking in the reverence
          for personalities, or inexorably fetter them beforehand with the
          manacles of convention.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>240.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Wish to
          Appear Vain.</span></span>—In conversation with strangers or
          little-known acquaintances, to express only selected thoughts, to
          speak of one's famous acquaintances, and important experiences and travels, is a
          sign that one is not proud, or at least would not like to appear
          proud. Vanity is the polite mask of pride.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>241.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Good
          Friendship.</span></span>—A good friendship arises when the one man
          deeply respects the other, more even than himself; loves him also,
          though not so much as himself; and finally, to facilitate
          intercourse, knows how to add the delicate bloom and veneer of
          intimacy, but at the same time wisely refrains from a true, real
          intimacy, from the confounding of <span>meum</span> and <span>tuum</span>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>242.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Friends as
          Ghosts.</span></span>—If we change ourselves vitally, our friends,
          who have not changed, become ghosts of our own past: their voice
          sounds shadowy and dreadful to us, as if we heard our own voice
          speaking, but younger, harder, less mellow.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>243.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>One Eye and Two
          Glances.</span></span>—The same people whose eyes naturally plead
          for favours and indulgences are accustomed, from their frequent
          humiliations and cravings for revenge, to assume a shameless glance
          as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>244.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Haze of
          Distance.</span></span>—A child throughout life—that sounds very
          touching, but is only the verdict from the distance. Seen and known
          close at hand, he is always called <span>“puerile
          throughout life.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>245.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Advantage and
          Disadvantage in the Same Misunderstanding.</span></span>—The mute
          perplexity of the subtle brain is usually understood by the
          non-subtle as a silent superiority, and is much dreaded whereas the
          perception of perplexity would produce good will.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>246.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Sage giving
          Himself out to be a Fool.</span></span>—The philanthropy of the
          sage sometimes makes him decide to pretend to be excited, enraged,
          or delighted, so that he may not hurt his surroundings by the
          coldness and rationality of his true nature.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>247.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Forcing Oneself
          to Attention.</span></span>—So soon as we note that any one in
          intercourse and conversation with us has to force himself to
          attention, we have adequate evidence that he loves us not, or loves
          us no longer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>248.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Way to a
          Christian Virtue.</span></span>—Learning from one's enemies is the
          best way to love them, for it inspires us with a grateful mood
          towards them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>249.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Stratagem of
          the Importunate.</span></span>—The importunate man gives us gold
          coins as change for our convention coins, and thereby tries to
          force us afterwards to treat our convention as an oversight and him
          as an exception.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>250.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Reason for
          Dislike.</span></span>—We become hostile to many an artist or
          writer, not because we notice in the end that he has duped us, but
          because he did not find more subtle means necessary to entrap
          us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>251.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>In
          Parting.</span></span>—Not by the way one soul approaches another,
          but by the way it separates, do I recognise its relationship and
          homogeneity with the other.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>252.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Silentium.</span></span>—We must not
          speak about our friends, or we renounce the sentiment of
          friendship.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>253.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Impoliteness.</span></span>—Impoliteness
          is often the sign of a clumsy modesty, which when taken by surprise
          loses its head and would fain hide the fact by means of
          rudeness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>254.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Honesty's
          Miscalculation.</span></span>—Our newest acquaintances are
          sometimes the first to learn what we have hitherto kept dark. We
          have the foolish notion that our proof of confidence is the
          strongest fetter wherewith to hold them fast. But <em><span>they</span></em> do
          not know enough about us to feel so strongly the sacrifice involved
          in our speaking out, and betray our secrets to others without any
          idea of betrayal. Hereby we possibly lose our old friends.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>255.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>In the
          Ante-Chamber of Favour.</span></span>—All men whom we let stand
          long in the ante-chamber of our favour get into a state of
          fermentation or become bitter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>256.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Warning to the
          Despised.</span></span>—When we have sunk unmistakably in the
          estimation of mankind we should cling tooth and nail to modesty in
          intercourse, or we shall betray to others that we have sunk in our
          own estimation as well. Cynicism in intercourse is a sign that a
          man, when alone, treats himself too as a dog.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>257.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Ignorance often
          Ennobles.</span></span>—With regard to the respect of those who pay
          respect, it is an advantage ostensibly not to understand certain
          things. Ignorance, too, confers privileges.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>258.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Opponent of
          Grace.</span></span>—The impatient and arrogant man does not care
          for grace, feeling it to be a corporeal, visible reproach against
          himself. For grace is heartfelt toleration in movement and
          gesture.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>259.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>On Seeing
          Again.</span></span>—When old friends see each other again after a
          long separation, it often happens that they affect an interest in
          matters to which they have long since become indifferent. Sometimes both remark this, but
          dare not raise the veil—from a mournful doubt. Hence arise conversations as in the realm of the dead.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>260.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Making Friends
          only with the Industrious.</span></span>—The man of leisure is
          dangerous to his friends, for, having nothing to do, he talks of
          what his friends are doing or not doing, interferes, and finally
          makes himself a nuisance. The clever man will only make friends
          with the industrious.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>261.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>One Weapon
          twice as Much as Two.</span></span>—It is an unequal combat when
          one man defends his cause with head and heart, the other with head
          alone. The first has sun and wind against him, as it were, and his
          two weapons interfere with each other: he loses the prize—in the
          eyes of truth. True, the victory of the second, with his one
          weapon, is seldom a victory after the hearts of all the other
          spectators, and makes him unpopular.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>262.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Depth and
          Troubled Waters.</span></span>—The public easily confounds him who
          fishes in troubled waters with him who pumps up from the
          depths.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>263.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Demonstrating
          One's Vanity to Friend and Foe.</span></span>—Many a man, from
          vanity, maltreats even his friends, when in the presence of witnesses to whom he
          wishes to make his own preponderance clear. Others exaggerate the
          merits of their enemies, in order to point proudly to the fact that
          they are worthy of such foes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>264.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Cooling
          Off.</span></span>—The over-heating of the heart is generally
          allied with illness of the head and judgment. He who is concerned
          for a time with the health of his head must know what he has to
          cool, careless of the future of his heart. For if we are capable at
          all of giving warmth, we are sure to become warm again and then
          have our summer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>265.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Mingled
          Feelings.</span></span>—Towards science women and self-seeking
          artists entertain a feeling that is composed of envy and
          sentimentality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>266.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Where Danger is
          Greatest.</span></span>—We seldom break our leg so long as life
          continues a toilsome upward climb. The danger comes when we begin
          to take things easily and choose the convenient paths.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>267.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Not too
          Early.</span></span>—We must beware of becoming sharp too early, or
          we shall also become thin too early.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>268.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Joy in
          Refractoriness.</span></span>—The good teacher knows cases where he
          is proud that his pupil remains true to himself in opposition to him—at times
          when the youth must not understand the man or would be harmed by
          understanding him.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>269.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Experiment
          of Honesty.</span></span>—Young men, who wish to be more honest
          than they have been, seek as victim some one acknowledged to be
          honest, attacking him first with an attempt to reach his height by
          abuse—with the underlying notion that this first experiment at any
          rate is void of danger. For just such a one has no right to
          chastise the impudence of the honest man.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>270.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Eternal
          Child.</span></span>—We think, short-sighted that we are, that
          fairy-tales and games belong to childhood. As if at any age we
          should care to live without fairy-tales and games! Our words and
          sentiments are indeed different, but the essential fact remains the
          same, as is proved by the child himself looking on games as his
          work and fairy-tales as his truth. The shortness of life ought to
          preserve us from a pedantic distinction between the different
          ages—as if every age brought something new—and a poet ought one day
          to portray a man of two hundred, who really lives without
          fairy-tales and games.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>271.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Every
          Philosophy is the Philosophy of a Period of Life.</span></span>—The
          period of life in which a philosopher finds his teaching is
          manifested by his teaching; he cannot avoid that, however elevated above time and
          hour he may feel himself. Thus, Schopenhauer's philosophy remains a
          mirror of his hot and melancholy youth—it is no mode of thought for
          older men. Plato's philosophy reminds one of the middle thirties,
          when a warm and a cold current generally rush together, so that
          spray and delicate clouds and, under favourable circumstances and
          glimpses of sunshine, enchanting rainbow-pictures result.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>272.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Of the
          Intellect of Women.</span></span>—The intellectual strength of a
          woman is best proved by the fact that she offers her own intellect
          as a sacrifice out of love for a man and his intellect, and that
          nevertheless in the new domain, which was previously foreign to her
          nature, a second intellect at once arises as an aftergrowth, to
          which the man's mind impels her.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>273.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Raising and
          Lowering in the Sexual Domain.</span></span>—The storm of desire
          will sometimes carry a man up to a height where all desire is
          silenced, where he really loves and lives in a better state of
          being rather than in a better state of choice. On the other hand, a
          good woman, from true love, often climbs down to desire, and lowers
          herself in her own eyes. The latter action in particular is one of
          the most pathetic sensations which the idea of a good marriage can
          involve.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>274.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Man Promises,
          Woman Fulfils.</span></span>—By woman Nature shows how far she has
          hitherto achieved her task of fashioning humanity, by man she shows
          what she has had to overcome and what she still proposes to do for
          humanity.—The most perfect woman of every age is the holiday-task
          of the Creator on every seventh day of culture, the recreation of
          the artist from his work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>275.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Transplanting.</span></span>—If we have
          spent our intellect in order to gain mastery over the intemperance
          of the passions, the sad result often follows that we transfer the
          intemperance to the intellect, and from that time forth are
          extravagant in thought and desire of knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>276.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Laughter as
          Treachery.</span></span>—How and when a woman laughs is a sign of
          her culture, but in the ring of laughter her nature reveals itself,
          and in highly cultured women perhaps even the last insoluble
          residue of their nature. Hence the psychologist will say with
          Horace, though from different reasons: <span>“Ridete puellae.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>277.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>From the
          Youthful Soul.</span></span>—Youths varyingly show devotion and
          impudence towards the same person, because at bottom they only
          despise or admire themselves in that other person, and between
          the two feelings but stagger to and fro in themselves, so long as they have not found in
          experience the measure of their will and ability.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>278.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>For the
          Amelioration of the World.</span></span>—If we forbade the
          discontented, the sullen, and the atrabilious to propagate, we
          might transform the world into a garden of happiness.—This aphorism
          belongs to a practical philosophy for the female sex.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>279.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Not to Distrust
          your Emotions.</span></span>—The feminine phrase <span>“Do not distrust your emotions”</span> does not mean
          much more than <span>“Eat what tastes good to
          you.”</span> This may also, especially for moderate natures, be a
          good everyday rule. But other natures must live according to
          another maxim: <span>“You must eat not only with
          your mouth but also with your brain, in order that the greediness

<p><span><span>A Cruel Fancy
          of Love.</span></span>—Every great love involves the cruel thought
          of killing the object of love, so that it may be removed once for
          all from the mischievous play of change. For love is more afraid of
          change than of destruction.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>281.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Doors.</span></span>—In everything that
          is learnt or experienced, the child, just like the man, sees doors;
          but for the former they are places to go <em><span>to</span></em>, for the latter to go
          <em><span>through</span></em>.</p>

<span>282.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Sympathetic
          Women.</span></span>—The sympathy of women, which is talkative,

<div>
<h2>
<span>283.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Early
          Merit.</span></span>—He who acquires merit early in life tends to
          forget all reverence for age and old people, and accordingly,
          greatly to his disadvantage, excludes himself from the society of
          the mature, those who confer maturity. Thus in spite of his early
          merit he remains green, importunate, and boyish longer than
          others.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>284.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Souls All of a
          Piece.</span></span>—Women and artists think that where we do not
          contradict them we cannot. Reverence on ten counts and silent
          disapproval on ten others appears to them an impossible
          combination, because their souls are all of a piece.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>285.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Young
          Talents.</span></span>—With respect to young talents we must
          strictly follow Goethe's maxim, that we should often avoid harming
          error in order to avoid harming truth. Their condition is like the
          diseases of pregnancy, and involves strange appetites. These
          appetites should be satisfied and humoured as far as possible, for
          the sake of the fruit they may be expected to produce. It is true
          that, as nurse of these remarkable invalids, one must learn the difficult art of voluntary
          self-abasement.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>286.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Disgust with
          Truth.</span></span>—Women are so constituted that all truth (in
          relation to men, love, children, society, aim of life) disgusts
          them—and that they try to be revenged on every one who opens their
          eyes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>287.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Source of
          Great Love.</span></span>—Whence arises the sudden passion of a man
          for a woman, a passion so deep, so vital? Least of all from
          sensuality only: but when a man finds weakness, need of help, and
          high spirits united in the same creature, he suffers a sort of
          overflowing of soul, and is touched and offended at the same
          moment. At this point arises the source of great love.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>288.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Cleanliness.</span></span>—In the child,
          the sense for cleanliness should be fanned into a passion, and then
          later on he will raise himself, in ever new phases, to almost every
          virtue, and will finally appear, in compensation for all talent, as
          a shining cloud of purity, temperance, gentleness, and character,
          happy in himself and spreading happiness around.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>289.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Of Vain Old
          Men.</span></span>—Profundity of thought belongs to youth, clarity
          of thought to old age. When, in spite of this, old men sometimes speak and write in the
          manner of the profound, they do so from vanity, imagining that they
          thereby assume the charm of juvenility, enthusiasm, growth,
          apprehensiveness, hopefulness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>290.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Enjoyment of
          Novelty.</span></span>—Men use a new lesson or experience later on
          as a ploughshare or perhaps also as a weapon, women at once make it
          into an ornament.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>291.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>How both Sexes
          behave when in the Right.</span></span>—If it is conceded to a
          woman that she is right, she cannot deny herself the triumph of
          setting her heel on the neck of the vanquished; she must taste her
          victory to the full. On the other hand, man towards man in such a
          case is ashamed of being right. But then man is accustomed to
          victory; with woman it is an exception.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>292.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Abnegation in
          the Will to Beauty.</span></span>—In order to become beautiful, a
          woman must not desire to be considered pretty. That is to say, in
          ninety-nine out of a hundred cases where she could please she must
          scorn and put aside all thoughts of pleasing. Only then can she
          ever reap the delight of him whose soul's portal is wide enough to
          admit the great.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>293.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Unintelligible,
          Unendurable.</span></span>—A youth cannot understand that an old
          man has also had his delights, his dawns of feeling, his changings and soarings of
          thought. It offends him to think that such things have existed
          before. But it makes him very bitter to hear that, to become
          fruitful, he must lose those buds and dispense with their
          fragrance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>294.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Party with
          the Air of Martyrdom.</span></span>—Every party that can assume an
          air of martyrdom wins good-natured souls over to its side and
          thereby itself acquires an air of good nature—greatly to its
          advantage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>295.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Assertions
          surer than Arguments.</span></span>—An assertion has, with the
          majority of men at any rate, more effect than an argument, for
          arguments provoke mistrust. Hence demagogues seek to strengthen the
          arguments of their party by assertions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>296.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Best
          Concealers.</span></span>—All regularly successful men are
          profoundly cunning in making their faults and weaknesses look like
          manifestations of strength. This proves that they must know their
          defects uncommonly well.</p>

<p><span><span>From Time to
          Time.</span></span>—He sat in the city gateway and said to one who
          passed through that this was the city gate. The latter replied that
          this was true, but that one must not be too much in the
          right if one expected to be thanked for it. <span>“Oh,”</span>
          answered the other, <span>“I don't want thanks,
          but from time to time it is very pleasant not merely to be in the
          right but to remain in the right.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>298.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Virtue was not
          Invented by the Germans.</span></span>—Goethe's nobleness and
          freedom from envy, Beethoven's fine hermitical resignation,
          Mozart's cheerfulness and grace of heart, Handel's unbending
          manliness and freedom under the law, Bach's confident and luminous
          inner life, such as does not even need to renounce glamour and
          success—are these qualities peculiarly German?—If they are not,
          they at least prove to what goal Germans should strive and to what
          they can attain.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>299.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Pia
          Fraus</span></span> <span>or
          Something Else.</span></span>—I hope I am mistaken, but I think
          that in Germany of to-day a twofold sort of hypocrisy is set up as
          the duty of the moment for every one. From imperial-political
          misgivings Germanism is demanded, and from social apprehensions
          Christianity—but both only in words and gestures, and particularly
          in ability to keep silent. It is the veneer that nowadays costs so
          much and is paid for so highly; and for the benefit of the
          spectators the face of the nation assumes German and Christian
          wrinkles.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>300.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>How far even in
          the Good the Half may be More than the Whole.</span></span>—In all
          things that are constructed to last and demand the service of many hands, much
          that is less good must be made a rule, although the organiser knows
          what is better and harder very well. He will calculate that there
          will never be a lack of persons who <em><span>can</span></em>
          correspond to the rule, and he knows that the middling good is the
          rule.—The youth seldom sees this point, and as an innovator thinks
          how marvellously he is in the right and how strange is the
          blindness of others.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>301.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The
          Partisan.</span></span>—The true partisan learns nothing more, he
          only experiences and judges. It is significant that Solon, who was
          never a partisan but pursued his aims above and apart from parties
          or even against them, was the father of that simple phrase wherein
          lies the secret of the health and vitality of Athens: <span>“I grow old, but I am always learning.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>302.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>What is German
          according to Goethe.</span></span>—They are really intolerable
          people of whom one cannot even accept the good, who have freedom of
          disposition but do not remark that they are lacking in freedom of
          taste and spirit. Yet just this, according to Goethe's well-weighed
          judgment, is German.—His voice and his example indicate that the
          German should be more than a German if he wishes to be useful or
          even endurable to other nations—and which direction his striving
          should take, in order that he may rise above and beyond
          himself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>303.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>When it is
          Necessary to Remain Stationary.</span></span>—When the masses begin
          to rage, and reason is under a cloud, it is a good thing, if the
          health of one's soul is not quite assured, to go under a doorway
          and look out to see what the weather is like.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>304.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The
          Revolution-Spirit and the Possession-Spirit.</span></span>—The only
          remedy against Socialism that still lies in your power is to avoid
          provoking Socialism—in other words, to live in moderation and
          contentment, to prevent as far as possible all lavish display, and
          to aid the State as far as possible in its taxing of all
          superfluities and luxuries. You do not like this remedy? Then, you
          rich bourgeois who call yourselves <span>“Liberals,”</span> confess that it is your own
          inclination that you find so terrible and menacing in Socialists,
          but allow to prevail in yourselves as unavoidable, as if with you
          it were something different. As you are constituted, if you had not
          your fortune and the cares of maintaining it, this bent of yours
          would make Socialists of you. Possession alone differentiates you
          from them. If you wish to conquer the assailants of your
          prosperity, you must first conquer yourselves.—And if that
          prosperity only meant well-being, it would not be so external and
          provocative of envy; it would be more generous, more benevolent,
          more compensatory, more helpful. But the spurious, histrionic
          element in your pleasures, which lie more in the feeling of
          contrast (because others have them not, and feel envious)
          than in feelings of
          realised and heightened power—your houses, dresses, carriages,
          shops, the demands of your palates and your tables, your noisy
          operatic and musical enthusiasm; lastly your women, formed and
          fashioned but of base metal, gilded but without the ring of gold,
          chosen by you for show and considering themselves meant for
          show—these are the things that spread the poison of that national
          disease, which seizes the masses ever more and more as a
          Socialistic heart-itch, but has its origin and breeding-place in
          you. Who shall now arrest this epidemic?</p>

<span>305.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Party
          Tactics.</span></span>—When a party observes that a previous member
          has changed from an unqualified to a qualified adherent, it endures
          it so ill that it irritates and mortifies him in every possible way
          with the object of forcing him to a decisive break and making him
          an opponent. For the party suspects that the intention of finding a
          relative value in its faith, a value which admits of pro and con,
          of weighing and discarding, is more dangerous than downright
          opposition.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>306.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>For the
          Strengthening of Parties.</span></span>—Whoever wishes to
          strengthen a party internally should give it an opportunity of
          being forcibly treated with obvious injustice. The party thus
          acquires a capital of good conscience, which hitherto it perhaps
          lacked.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>307.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>To Provide for
          One's Past.</span></span>—As men after all only respect the
          old-established and slowly developed, he who would survive after
          his death must not only provide for posterity but still more for
          the past. Hence tyrants of every sort (including tyrannical artists
          and politicians) like to do violence to history, so that history
          may seem a preparation and a ladder up to them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>308.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Party
          Writers.</span></span>—The beating of drums, which delights young
          writers who serve a party, sounds to him who does not belong to the
          party like a rattling of chains, and excites sympathy rather than
          admiration.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>309.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Taking Sides
          against Ourselves.</span></span>—Our followers never forgive us for
          taking sides against ourselves, for we seem in their eyes not only
          to be spurning their love but to be exposing them to the charge of
          lack of intelligence.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>310.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Danger in
          Wealth.</span></span>—Only a man of intellect should hold property:
          otherwise property is dangerous to the community. For the owner,
          not knowing how to make use of the leisure which his possessions
          might secure to him, will continue to strive after more property.
          This strife will be his occupation, his strategy in the war with
          ennui. So in the end real wealth is produced from the moderate property that would be
          enough for an intellectual man. Such wealth, then, is the
          glittering outcrop of intellectual dependence and poverty, but it
          looks quite different from what its humble origin might lead one to
          expect, because it can mask itself with culture and art—it can, in
          fact, purchase the mask. Hence it excites envy in the poor and
          uncultured—who at bottom always envy culture and see no mask in the
          mask—and gradually paves the way for a social revolution. For a
          gilded coarseness and a histrionic blowing of trumpets in the
          pretended enjoyment of culture inspires that class with the
          thought, <span>“It is only a matter of
          money,”</span> whereas it is indeed to some extent a matter of
          money, but far more of intellect.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>311.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Joy in
          Commanding and Obeying.</span></span>—Commanding is a joy, like
          obeying; the former when it has not yet become a habit, the latter
          just when it has become a habit. Old servants under new masters
          advance each other mutually in giving pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>312.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Ambition for a

<p><span><span>Party
          Usage.</span></span>—Every party attempts to represent the

          bitterly, the more excellent they are.</p>
</div>

<span>315.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Becoming

          were once full and rich.</p>
</div>
<div>

<span>316.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Welcome
          Enemies.</span></span>—The Socialistic movements are nowadays
          becoming more and more agreeable rather than terrifying to the
          dynastic governments, because by these movements they are provided
          with a right and a weapon for making exceptional rules, and can
          thus attack their real bogies, democrats and anti-dynasts.—Towards
          all that such governments professedly detest they feel a secret
          cordiality and inclination. But they are compelled to draw the veil

          make men feel freer and more independent; one step farther, and
          possession becomes lord, the possessor a slave. The latter must
          sacrifice his time,
          his thoughts to the former, and feels himself compelled to an
          intercourse, nailed to a spot, incorporated with the State—perhaps
          quite in conflict with his real and essential needs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>318.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Of the Mastery
          of Them that Know.</span></span>—It is easy, ridiculously easy, to
          set up a model for the choice of a legislative body. First of all
          the honest and reliable men of the nation, who at the same time are
          masters and experts in some one branch, have to become prominent by
          mutual scenting-out and recognition. From these, by a narrower
          process of selection, the learned and expert of the first rank in
          each individual branch must again be chosen, also by mutual
          recognition and guarantee. If the legislative body be composed of
          these, it will finally be necessary, in each individual case, that
          only the voices and judgments of the most specialised experts
          should decide; the honesty of all the rest should have become so
          great that it is simply a matter of decency to leave the voting
          also in the hands of these men. The result would be that the law,
          in the strictest sense, would emanate from the intelligence of the
          most intelligent.—As things now are, voting is done by parties, and
          at every division there must be hundreds of uneasy consciences
          among the ill-taught, the incapable of judgment, among those who
          merely repeat, imitate, and go with the tide. Nothing lowers the
          dignity of a new law so much as this inherent shamefaced feeling of
          insincerity that necessarily results at every party division. But, as has been said,
          it is easy, ridiculously easy, to set up such a model: no power on
          earth is at present strong enough to realise such an ideal—unless
          the belief in the highest utility of knowledge, and of those that
          know, at last dawns even upon the most hostile minds and is
          preferred to the prevalent belief in majorities. In the sense of
          such a future may our watchword be: <span>“More
          reverence for them that know, and down with all
          parties!”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Of the</span>

          vague, vacillating, premonitory, elementary, intuitive elements—to
          choose obscure names for obscure things—that are attributed to the
          German nature would be, if they really still existed, a proof that
          our culture has remained several stages behind and is still
          surrounded by the spell and atmosphere of the Middle Ages.—It is
          true that in this backwardness there are certain advantages: by
          these qualities the Germans (if, as has been said before, they
          still possess them) would possess the capacity, which other nations
          have now lost, for doing certain things and particularly for
          understanding certain things. Much undoubtedly is lost if the lack
          of sense—which is just the common factor in all those qualities—is
          lost. Here too, however, there are no losses without the highest
          compensatory gains, so that no reason is left for lamenting,
          granting that we do not, like children, and gourmands, wish to
          enjoy at once the fruits of all seasons of the year.</p>

<p><span><span>Carrying Coals
          to Newcastle.</span></span>—The governments of the great States
          have two instruments for keeping the people dependent, in fear and
          obedience: a coarser, the army, and a more refined, the school.
          With the aid of the former they win over to their side the ambition
          of the higher strata and the strength of the lower, so far as both
          are characteristic of active and energetic men of moderate or
          inferior gifts. With the aid of the latter they win over gifted
          poverty, especially the intellectually pretentious semi-poverty of
          the middle classes. Above all, they make teachers of all grades
          into an intellectual court looking unconsciously <span>“towards the heights.”</span> By putting obstacle after
          obstacle in the way of private schools and the wholly distasteful
          individual tuition they secure the disposal of a considerable
          number of educational posts, towards which numerous hungry and
          submissive eyes are turned to an extent five times as great as can
          ever be satisfied. These posts, however, must support the holder
          but meagrely, so that he maintains a feverish thirst for promotion
          and becomes still more closely attached to the views of the
          government. For it is always more advantageous to foster moderate
          discontent than contentment, the mother of courage, the grandmother
          of free thought and exuberance. By means of this physically and
          mentally bridled body of teachers, the youth of the country is as
          far as possible raised to a certain level of culture that is useful
          to the State and arranged on a suitable sliding-scale. Above all,
          the immature and ambitious minds of all classes are almost imperceptibly imbued
          with the idea that only a career which is recognised and
          hall-marked by the State can lead immediately to social
          distinction. The effect of this belief in government examinations
          and titles goes so far that even men who have remained independent
          and have risen by trade or handicraft still feel a pang of
          discontent in their hearts until their position too is marked and
          acknowledged by a gracious bestowal of rank and orders from
          above—until one becomes a <span>“somebody.”</span> Finally the State connects all these
          hundreds of offices and posts in its hands with the obligation of
          being trained and hallmarked in these State schools if one ever
          wishes to enter this charmed circle. Honour in society, daily
          bread, the possibility of a family, protection from above, the
          feeling of community in a common culture—all this forms a network
          of hopes into which every young man walks: how should he feel the
          slightest breath of mistrust? In the end, perhaps, the obligation
          of being a soldier for one year has become with every one, after
          the lapse of a few generations, an unreflecting habit, an
          understood thing, with an eye to which we construct the plan of our
          lives quite early. Then the State can venture on the master-stroke
          of weaving together school and army, talent, ambition and strength
          by means of common advantages—that is, by attracting the more
          highly gifted on favourable terms to the army and inspiring them
          with the military spirit of joyful obedience; so that finally,
          perhaps, they become attached permanently to the flag and endow it
          by their talents with an ever new and more brilliant lustre. Then nothing more is wanted but
          an opportunity for great wars. These are provided from professional
          reasons (and so in all innocence) by diplomats, aided by newspapers
          and Stock Exchanges. For <span>“the
          nation,”</span> as a nation of soldiers, need never be supplied
          with a good conscience in war—it has one already.</p>

<p><span><span>The
          Press.</span></span>—If we consider how even to-day all great
          political transactions glide upon the stage secretly and
          stealthily; how they are hidden by unimportant events, and seem
          small when close at hand; how they only show their far-reaching
          effect, and leave the soil still quaking, long after they have
          taken place;—what significance can we attach to the Press in its
          present position, with its daily expenditure of lung-power in order
          to bawl, to deafen, to excite, to terrify? Is it anything more than
          an everlasting false alarm, which tries to lead our ears and our
          wits into a false direction?</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span>322.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>After a Great
          Event.</span></span>—A nation and a man whose soul has come to
          light through some great event generally feel the immediate need of
          some act of childishness or coarseness, as much from shame as for
          purposes of recreation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>323.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>To be a Good
          German means to de-Germanise Oneself.</span></span>—National
          differences consist, far more than has hitherto been observed, only in the differences
          of various grades of culture, and are only to a very small extent
          permanent (nor even that in a strict sense). For this reason all
          arguments based on national character are so little binding on one
          who aims at the alteration of convictions—in other words, at
          culture. If, for instance, we consider all that has already been
          German, we shall improve upon the hypothetical question,
          <span>“What is German?”</span> by the
          counter-question, <span>“What is <em><span>now</span></em>
          German?”</span> and every good German will answer it practically,
          by overcoming his German characteristics. For when a nation
          advances and grows, it bursts the girdle previously given to it by
          its national outlook. When it remains stationary or declines, its
          soul is surrounded by a fresh girdle, and the crust, as it becomes
          harder and harder, builds a prison around, with walls growing ever
          higher. Hence if a nation has much that is firmly established, this
          is a sign that it wishes to petrify and would like to become
          nothing but a monument. This happened, from a definite date, in the
          case of Egypt. So he who is well-disposed towards the Germans may
          for his part consider how he may more and more grow out of what is
          German. The tendency to be un-German has therefore always been a
          mark of efficient members of our nation.</p>

<span>324.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Foreignisms.</span></span>—A foreigner
          who travelled in Germany found favour or the reverse by certain
          assertions of his, according to the districts in which he stayed.
          All intelligent Suabians, he used to say, are coquettish.—The other Suabians still
          believed that Uhland was a poet and Goethe immoral.—The best about
          German novels now in vogue was that one need not read them, for one
          knew already what they contained.—The native of Berlin seemed more
          good-humoured than the South German, for he was all too fond of
          mocking, and so could endure mockery himself, which the South
          German could not.—The intellect of the Germans was kept down by
          their beer and their newspapers: he recommended them tea and
          pamphlets, of course as a cure.—He advised us to contemplate the
          different nations of worn-out Europe and see how well each
          displayed some particular quality of old age, to the delight of
          those who sit before the great spectacle: how the French
          successfully represent the cleverness and amiability of old age,
          the English the experience and reserve, the Italians the innocence
          and candour. Can the other masks of old age be wanting? Where is
          the proud old man, the domineering old man, the covetous old
          man?—The most dangerous region in Germany was Saxony and Thuringia:
          nowhere else was there more mental nimbleness, more knowledge of
          men, side by side with freedom of thought; and all this was so
          modestly veiled by the ugly dialect and the zealous officiousness
          of the inhabitants that one hardly noticed that one here had to
          deal with the intellectual drill-sergeants of Germany, her teachers
          for good or evil.—The arrogance of the North Germans was kept in
          check by their tendency to obey, that of the South Germans by their
          tendency—to make themselves comfortable.—It appeared to him that
          in their women German men possessed awkward but self-opinionated housewives, who
          belauded themselves so perseveringly that they had almost persuaded
          the world, and at any rate their husbands, of their peculiarly
          German housewifely virtue.—When the conversation turned on
          Germany's home and foreign policy, he used to say (he called it
          <span>“betray the secret”</span>) that Germany's
          greatest statesman did not believe in great statesmen.—The future
          of Germany he found menaced and menacing, for Germans had forgotten
          how to enjoy themselves (an art that the Italians understood so
          well), but, by the great games of chance called wars and dynastic
          revolutions, had accustomed themselves to emotionalism, and
          consequently would one day have an <span>émeute</span>. For that is the
          strongest emotion that a nation can procure for itself.—The German
          Socialist was all the more dangerous because impelled by no
          definite necessity: his trouble lay in not knowing what he wanted;
          so, even if he attained many of his objects, he would still pine
          away from desire in the midst of delights, just like Faust, but
          presumably like a very vulgar Faust. <span>“For
          the Faust-Devil,”</span> he finally exclaimed, <span>“by whom cultured Germans were so much plagued, was
          exorcised by Bismarck; but now the Devil has entered into the
          swine, and is
          worse than ever!”</span></p>

<span>325.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Opinions.</span></span>—Most men are
          nothing and count for nothing until they have arrayed themselves in
          universal convictions and public opinions. This is in accordance with the
          tailors' philosophy, <span>“The apparel makes the
          man.”</span> Of exceptional men, however, it must be said,
          <span>“The wearer primarily makes the
          apparel.”</span> Here opinions cease to be public, and become
          something else than masks, ornament, and disguise.</p>

<p><span><span>Two Kinds of

<span>327.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Debasement of
          Joy.</span></span>—To call a thing good not a day longer than it
          appears to us good, and above all not a day earlier—that is the
          only way to keep joy pure. Otherwise, joy all too easily becomes
          insipid and rotten to the taste, and counts, for whole strata of
          the people, among the adulterated foodstuffs.</p>

<p><span><span>The Scapegoat

<p><span><span>Sovereignty.</span></span>—To honour and
          acknowledge even the bad, when it <em><span>pleases</span></em>
          one, and to have no conception of how one could be ashamed of being pleased thereat, is

<span>330.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Influence a

          learns that so far as he has influence he is a phantom in other
          brains, and perhaps he falls into a state of subtle vexation of
          soul, in which he asks himself whether he must not maintain this
          phantom of himself for the benefit of his fellow-men.</p>
</div>
<div>

<span>331.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Giving and

          fact that he has been given something greater, nay, even the
          greatest thing.</p>

<span>332.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Good

<p><span><span>Intercourse as

          with others, which he enjoys but seldom, as a special delicacy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>334.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>To Know how to
          Suffer in Public.</span></span>—We must advertise our misfortunes
          and from time to time heave audible sighs and show visible marks of
          impatience. For if we could let others see how assured and happy we
          are in spite of pain and privation, how envious and ill-tempered
          they would become at the sight!—But we must take care not to
          corrupt our fellow-men; besides, if they knew the truth, they would
          levy a heavy toll upon us. At any rate our public misfortune is our
          private advantage.</p>

<p><span><span>To Will the

          enough to practise the good one must have willed it, and, as the
          poet says, include the Godhead in our will. But the beautiful we
          must not will, we must be capable of it, in innocence and
          blindness, without any psychical curiosity. He that lights his
          lantern to find perfect men should remember the token by which to
          know them. They are the men who always act for the sake of the good
          and in so doing always attain to the beautiful without thinking of
          the beautiful. Many better and nobler men, from impotence or from
          want of beauty in their souls, remain unrefreshing and ugly to behold, with all their good
          will and good works. They rebuff and injure even virtue through the
          repulsive garb in which their bad taste arrays her.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>337.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Danger of
          Renunciation.</span></span>—We must beware of basing our lives on
          too narrow a foundation of appetite. For if we renounce all the
          joys involved in positions, honours, associations, revels, creature
          comforts, and arts, a day may come when we perceive that this
          repudiation has led us not to wisdom but to satiety of life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>338.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Final Opinion

          not know the way of the world, or belongs to the order of pious
          fire-eaters.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>339.</span></h2>
<p><span>“<span><span>Gaudamus

          healing forces for the moral nature of man. Otherwise, how comes it
          that our soul, as soon as it basks in the sunshine of joy,
          unconsciously vows to itself, <span>“I will be
          good!”</span> <span>“I will become
          perfect!”</span> and is at once seized by a premonition of

          and then, at a profound contemplation of all that is human, in its
          fulness, vigour, tenderness, and complexity, I have felt as if I
          must say, in all humility, <span>“Man also is too
          beautiful for the contemplation of man!”</span> Nor did I mean the

          joys, connections, health, and property of every kind, we perhaps
          discover in the end, after the first shock, that we are richer than
          before. For now we know for the first time what is so peculiarly
          ours that no robber hand can touch it, and perhaps, after all the
          plunder and devastation, we come forward with the airs of a mighty

          bearing, your eye, your dealings; and this deceitful something is
          as necessary as your usual honesty, but constantly destroys its

<p><span><span>Idealist and

          enjoys its own weariness and, happy in patient playing with
          patience, resembles the waves of a lake, which on a quiet summer
          day, in the reflection of a many-hued evening sky, sip and sip at
          the shore and again are hushed—without end, without purpose,
          without satiety, without need—all calm rejoicing in change, all ebb
          and flow of Nature's pulse.”</span> Such is the feeling and talk of
          all invalids, but if they attain that hour, a brief period of
          enjoyment is followed by ennui. But this is the thawing-wind of the

<p><span><span>Staircase
          Happiness.</span></span>—Just as the wit of many men does not keep
          pace with opportunity (so that opportunity has already passed
          through the door while wit still waits on the staircase outside),
          so others have a kind of staircase happiness, which walks too
          slowly to keep pace with swift-footed Time. The best that it can
          enjoy of an experience, of a whole span of life, falls to its share
          long afterwards, often only as a weak, spicy fragrance, giving rise
          to longing and sadness—as if <span>“it might have
          been possible”</span>—some time or other—to drink one's fill of
          this element: but now it is too late.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>353.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Worms.</span></span>—The fact that an

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>354.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Seat of
          Victory.</span></span>—A good seat on horseback robs an opponent of

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>355.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Danger in
          Admiration.</span></span>—From excessive admiration for the virtues
          of others one can lose the sense of one's own, and finally, through
          lack of practice, lose these virtues themselves, without retaining
          the alien virtues as compensation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>356.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Uses of
          Sickliness.</span></span>—He who is often ill not only has a far
          greater pleasure in health, on account of his so often getting
          well, but acquires a very keen sense of what is healthy or sickly
          in actions and achievements, both his own and others'. Thus, for
          example, it is just the writers of uncertain health—among whom,
          unfortunately, nearly all great writers must be classed—who are
          wont to have a far more even and assured tone of health in their
          writings, because they are better versed than are the physically
          robust in the philosophy of psychical health and convalescence and
          in their teachers—morning, sunshine, forest, and fountain.</p>

<p><span><span>Disloyalty a

          also is destined for mastery.</p>

<h2>
<span>358.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Never in

          exercise your strength in order to be able to climb higher
          to-morrow.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>360.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Sign of
          Radical Changes.</span></span>—When we dream of persons long
          forgotten or dead, it is a sign that we have suffered radical
          changes, and that the soil on which we live has been completely
          undermined. The dead rise again, and our antiquity becomes
          modernity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>361.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Medicine of the
          Soul.</span></span>—To lie still and think little is the cheapest

          good-will, becomes pleasanter every hour that it is used.</p>

<span>363.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The

          you thereto. All that develops in you out of that belief—cowardice,
          devotion or loftiness, and uprightness—bears witness to the soil in
          which the grain was sown, but not to the grain itself, for from
          that seed anything and everything can grow.</p>

<h2>
<span>364.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Reason for
          Much Fretfulness.</span></span>—He that prefers the beautiful to

          his digestion and acquire a very fretful outlook on the world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>365.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Excess as a
          Remedy.</span></span>—We can make our own talent once more
          acceptable to ourselves by honouring and enjoying the opposite
          talent for some time to excess.—Using excess as a remedy is one of
          the more refined devices in the art of life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>366.</span></h2>
<p><span>“<span><span>Will a

          according to the maxim, <span>“Know
          thyself,”</span> but as if always confronted with the command,
          <span>“Will a self, so you will become a
          self.”</span>—Fate seems always to have left them a choice.
          Inactive, contemplative natures, on the other hand, reflect on how
          they have chosen their self <span>“once for
          all”</span> at their entry into life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>367.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>To Live as Far
          as Possible without a Following.</span></span>—How small is the

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>368.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Obscuring
          Oneself.</span></span>—We must understand how to obscure ourselves

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>369.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Ennui.</span></span>—There is an ennui
          of the most subtle and cultured brains, to which the best that the
          world can offer has become stale. Accustomed to eat ever more and
          more recherché fare and to feel disgust at coarser diet, they are
          in danger of dying of hunger. For the very best exists but in small
          quantities, and has sometimes become inaccessible or hard as stone,
          so that even good teeth can no longer bite it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>370.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Danger in
          Admiration.</span></span>—The admiration of a quality or of an art
          may be so strong as to deter us from aspiring to possess that
          quality or art.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>371.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>What is
          Required of Art.</span></span>—One man wants to enjoy himself by

          artists.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>373.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>After
          Death.</span></span>—It is only long after the death of a man that
          we find it inconceivable that he should be missed—in the case of
          really great men, only after decades. Those who are honest usually
          think when any one dies that he is not much missed, and that the pompous
          funeral oration is a piece of hypocrisy. Necessity first teaches
          the necessariness of an individual, and the proper epitaph is a
          belated sigh.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>374.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Leaving in
          Hades.</span></span>—We must leave many things in the Hades of
          half-conscious feeling, and not try to release them from their
          shadow-existence, or else they will become, as thoughts and words,
          our demoniacal tyrants, with cruel lust after our blood.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>375.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Near to
          Beggary.</span></span>—Even the richest intellect sometimes mislays
          the key to the room in which his hoarded treasures repose. He is
          then like the poorest of the poor, who must beg to get a
          living.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>376.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Chain-Thinkers.</span></span>—To him who
          has thought a great deal, every new thought that he hears or reads
          at once assumes the form of a chain.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>377.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Pity.</span></span>—In the gilded sheath

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>379.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Vanity of
          Combatants.</span></span>—He who has no hope of victory in a

          his style of fighting should be admired.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>380.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Philosophic

</div>
<div>

<p><span><span>Final Teaching
          of History.</span></span>—<span>“Oh that I had
          but lived in those times!”</span> is the exclamation of foolish and
          frivolous men. At every period of history that we seriously review,
          even if it be the most belauded era of the past, we shall rather
          cry out at the end, <span>“Anything but a return
          to that! The spirit of that age would oppress you with the weight
          of a hundred atmospheres, the good and beautiful in it you would
          not enjoy, its evil you could not digest.”</span> Depend upon it,
          posterity will pass the same verdict on our own epoch, and say that
          it was unbearable, that life under such conditions was intolerable.
          <span>“And yet every one can endure his own
          times?”</span> Yes, because the spirit of his age not only lies <em><span>upon</span></em>
          him but is <em><span>in</span></em> him. The spirit of the age
          offers resistance to itself and can bear itself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>383.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Greatness as a
          Mask.</span></span>—By greatness in our comportment we embitter our
          foes; by envy that we do not conceal we almost reconcile them to
          us. For envy levels and makes equal; it is an unconscious,
          plaintive variety of modesty.—It may be indeed that here and there,
          for the sake of the above-named advantage, envy has been assumed as
          a mask by those who are not envious. Certainly, however, greatness
          in comportment is often used as the mask of envy by ambitious men
          who would rather suffer drawbacks and embitter their foes than let
          it be seen that they place them on an equal footing with
          themselves.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>384.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Unpardonable.</span></span>—You gave him

          that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>385.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Contrasts.</span></span>—The most senile
          thought ever conceived about men lies in the famous saying,
          <span>“The ego is always hateful,”</span> the
          most childish in the still more famous saying, <span>“Love thy neighbour as thyself.”</span>—With the one
          knowledge of men has ceased, with the other it has not yet
          begun.</p>
</div>
<div>

<span>386.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Defective

          mob so long as we always shift the blame on to others; we are on
          the track of wisdom when we always make ourselves alone
          responsible; but the wise man finds no one to blame, neither
          himself nor others.”</span>—Who said that? Epictetus, eighteen
          hundred years ago.—The world has heard but forgotten the
          saying.—No, the world has not heard and not forgotten it:
          everything is not forgotten. But we had not the necessary ear, the
          ear of Epictetus.—So he whispered it into his own ear?—Even so:
          wisdom is the whispering of the sage to himself in the crowded
          market-place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>387.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Defect of
          Standpoint, not of Vision.</span></span>—We always stand a few
          paces too near ourselves and a few paces too far from our
          neighbour. Hence we judge him too much in the lump, and ourselves
          too much by individual, occasional, insignificant features and
          circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>388.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Ignorance about
          Weapons.</span></span>—How little we care whether another knows a
          subject or not!—whereas he perhaps sweats blood at the bare idea
          that he may be considered ignorant on the point. Yes, there are
          exquisite fools, who always go about with a quiverful of mighty,
          excommunicatory utterances, ready to shoot down any one who shows
          freely that there are matters in which their judgment is not taken
          into account.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>

<p><span><span>At the

          not admit that everything in the world has its lees and
          sediment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>390.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Singing-Birds.</span></span>—The

</div>
<div>
<h2>

<div>
<h2>
<span>393.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Comedy.</span></span>—We sometimes earn
          honour or love for actions and achievements which we have long
          since sloughed as the snake sloughs his skin. We are hereby easily
          seduced into becoming the comic actors of our own past, and into
          throwing the old skin once more about our shoulders—and that not
          merely from vanity, but from good-will towards our admirers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>394.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Mistake of
          Biographers.</span></span>—The small force that is required to
          launch a boat into the stream must not be confounded with the force of the
          stream that carries the boat along. Yet this mistake is made in
          nearly all biographies.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>395.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Not Buying too
          Dear.</span></span>—The things that we buy too dear we generally
          turn to bad use, because we have no love for them but only a
          painful recollection. Thus they involve a twofold drawback.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>396.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Philosophy
          that Society always Needs.</span></span>—The pillars of the social
          structure rest upon the fundamental fact that every one cheerfully
          contemplates all that he is, does, and attempts, his sickness or
          health, his poverty or affluence, his honour or insignificance, and
          says to himself, <span>“After all, I would not
          change places with any one!”</span>—Whoever wishes to add a stone
          to the social structure should always try to implant in mankind
          this cheerful philosophy of contentment and refusal to change
          places.</p>

<span>397.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Mark of a

<div>
<h2>
<span>398.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Greatness and

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>399.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Being

<p><span><span>Advantage in

          wintry natures, who for once in a way are kissed by the rays of

<p><span><span>Recipe for the

<p><span><span>The Utility of

<p><span><span>They that

          thinks that the principal thing to the tree is the fruit, but in

          even my own blood have I spared. There were four pairs who
          responded to me in my sacrifice: Epicurus and Montaigne, Goethe and
          Spinoza, Plato and Rousseau, Pascal and Schopenhauer. With them I
          have to come to terms. When I have long wandered alone, I will let
          them prove me right or wrong; to them will I listen, if they prove
          each other right or wrong. In all that I say, conclude, or think
          out for myself and others, I fasten my eyes on those eight and see
          their eyes fastened on mine.—May the living forgive me if I look
          upon them at times as shadows, so pale and fretful, so restless
          and, alas! so eager for life. Those eight, on the other hand, seem
          to me so living that I feel as if even now, after their death, they
          could never become weary of life. But eternal vigour of life is the
          important point: what matters <span>“eternal
          life,”</span> or indeed life at all?</p>

<h1>
<span>Part II. The Wanderer And His
        Shadow.</span></h1>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: It is so long since I heard you speak that I
        should like to give you an opportunity of talking.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: I hear a voice—where? whose? I almost fancied
        that I heard myself speaking, but with a voice yet weaker than my
        own.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span> (after a pause): Are you not glad to have an
        opportunity of speaking?</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: By God and everything else in which I
        disbelieve, it is my shadow that speaks. I hear it, but I do not
        believe it.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: Let us assume that it exists, and think no more
        about it. In another hour all will be over.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: That is just what I thought when in a forest
        near Pisa I saw first two and then five camels.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: It is all the better if we are both equally
        forbearing towards each other when for once our reason is silent.
        Thus we shall avoid losing our tempers in conversation, and shall not
        at once apply mutual thumb-screws in the event of any word sounding
        for once unintelligible to us. If one does not know exactly how to
        answer, it is enough to say <em><span>something</span></em>. Those are the reasonable
        terms on which I hold conversation with any person. During a long
        talk the wisest of men becomes a fool once and a simpleton
        thrice.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: Your moderation is not flattering to those to
        whom you confess it.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: Am I, then, to flatter?</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: I thought a man's shadow was his vanity.
        Surely vanity would never say, <span>“Am I, then,
        to flatter?”</span></p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: Nor does human vanity, so far as I am
        acquainted with it, ask, as I have done twice, whether it may speak.
        It simply speaks.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: Now I see for the first time how rude I am to
        you, my beloved shadow. I have not said a word of my supreme
        <em><span>delight</span></em> in hearing and not merely
        seeing you. You must know that I love shadows even as I love light.
        For the existence of beauty of face, clearness of speech, kindliness
        and firmness of character, the shadow is as necessary as the light.
        They are not opponents—rather do they hold each other's hands like
        good friends; and when the light vanishes, the shadow glides after
        it.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: Yes, and I hate the same thing that you
        hate—night. I love men because they are votaries of life. I rejoice
        in the gleam of their eyes when they recognise and discover, they who
        never weary of recognising and discovering. That shadow which all
        things cast when the sunshine of knowledge falls upon them—that
        shadow too am I.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: I think I understand you, although you have
        expressed yourself in somewhat shadowy terms. You are right. Good friends give
        to each other here and there, as a sign of mutual understanding, an
        obscure phrase which to any third party is meant to be a riddle. And
        we are good friends, you and I. So enough of preambles! Some few
        hundred questions oppress my soul, and the time for you to answer
        them is perchance but short. Let us see how we may come to an
        understanding as quickly and peaceably as possible.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: But shadows are more shy than men. You will not
        reveal to any man the manner of our conversation?</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: <em><span>The manner</span></em> of our conversation?
        Heaven preserve me from wire-drawn, literary dialogues! If Plato had
        found less pleasure in spinning them out, his readers would have
        found more pleasure in Plato. A dialogue that in real life is a
        source of delight, when turned into writing and read, is a picture
        with nothing but false perspectives. Everything is too long or too
        short.—Yet perhaps I may reveal the <em><span>points on
        which</span></em> we have come to an understanding?</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: With that I am content. For every one will only
        recognise your views once more, and no one will think of the
        shadow.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: Perhaps you are wrong, my friend! Hitherto
        they have observed in my views more of the shadow than of me.</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Shadow</span></span>: More of the shadow than of the light? Is that
        possible?</p>
<p><span><span>The
        Wanderer</span></span>: Be serious, dear fool! My very first question
        demands seriousness.</p>
<div>
<h2>
<span>1.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Of the Tree of
          Knowledge.</span></span>—Probability, but no truth; the semblance
          of freedom, but no freedom—these are the two fruits by virtue of
          which the tree of knowledge cannot be confounded with the tree of
          life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>2.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The World's
          Reason.</span></span>—That the world is <em><span>not</span></em> the
          abstract essence of an eternal reasonableness is sufficiently
          proved by the fact that that <em><span>bit of the world</span></em> which we know—I
          mean our human reason—is none too reasonable. And if <em><span>this</span></em> is
          not eternally and wholly wise and reasonable, the rest of the world
          will not be so either. Here the conclusion <span><span>a
          minori ad majus, a parte ad totum</span></span> holds good, and
          that with decisive force.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>3.</span></h2>
<p><span>“<span><span>In the Beginning
          was.</span></span>”</span>—To glorify the origin—that is the
          metaphysical after-shoot which sprouts again at the contemplation
          of history, and absolutely makes us imagine that <em><span>in the
          beginning</span></em> of things lies all that is most valuable and
          essential.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>4.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Standard for
          the Value of Truth.</span></span>—The difficulty of climbing
          mountains is no gauge of their height. Yet in the case of science
          it is different!—we are told by certain persons who wish to be
          considered <span>“the initiated,”</span>—the
          difficulty in finding <span>truth</span> is to determine the value of truth! This insane morality
          originates in the idea that <span>“truths”</span>
          are really nothing more than gymnastic appliances, with which we
          have to exercise ourselves until we are thoroughly tired. It is a
          morality for the athletes and gymnasts of the intellect.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>5.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Use of Words
          and Reality.</span></span>—There exists a simulated contempt for
          all the things that mankind actually holds most important, for all
          everyday matters. For instance, we say <span>“we
          only eat to live”</span>—an abominable <em><span>lie</span></em>,
          like that which speaks of the procreation of children as the real
          purpose of all sexual pleasure. Conversely, the reverence for
          <span>“the most important things”</span> is
          hardly ever quite genuine. The priests and metaphysicians have
          indeed accustomed us to a hypocritically exaggerated <em><span>use of
          words</span></em> regarding these matters, but they have not
          altered the feeling that these most important things are not so
          important as those despised <span>“everyday
          matters.”</span> A fatal consequence of this twofold hypocrisy is
          that we never make these everyday matters (such as eating, housing,
          clothes, and intercourse) the object of a constant unprejudiced and
          <em><span>universal</span></em> reflection and revision,
          but, as such a process appears degrading, we divert from them our
          serious intellectual and artistic side. Hence in such matters habit
          and frivolity win an easy victory over the thoughtless, especially
          over inexperienced youth. On the other hand, our continual
          transgressions of the simplest laws of body and mind reduce us all,
          young and old, to a
          disgraceful state of dependence and servitude—I mean to that
          fundamentally superfluous dependence upon physicians, teachers and
          clergymen, whose dead-weight still lies heavy upon the whole of
          society.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>6.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Earthly
          Infirmities and their Main Cause.</span></span>—If we look about
          us, we are always coming across men who have eaten eggs all their
          lives without observing that the oblong-shaped taste the best; who
          do not know that a thunder-storm is beneficial to the stomach; that
          perfumes are most fragrant in cold, clear air; that our sense of
          taste varies in different parts of our mouths; that every meal at
          which we talk well or listen well does harm to the digestion. If we
          are not satisfied with these examples of defective powers of
          observation, we shall concede all the more readily that the
          everyday matters are very imperfectly seen and rarely observed by
          the majority. Is this a matter of indifference?—Let us remember,
          after all, that from this defect are derived <em><span>nearly all the
          bodily and spiritual infirmities</span></em> of the individual.
          Ignorance of what is good and bad for us, in the arrangement of our
          mode of life, the division of our day, the selection of our friends
          and the time we devote to them, in business and leisure, commanding
          and obeying, our feeling for nature and for art, our eating,
          sleeping, and meditation; ignorance and lack of keen perceptions
          <em><span>in the
          smallest and most ordinary details</span></em>—this it is that
          makes the world <span>“a vale of tears”</span>
          for so many. Let us not say that here as everywhere the fault lies with human
          <em><span>unreason</span></em>. Of reason there is
          enough and to spare, but it is <em><span>wrongly
          directed</span></em> and <em><span>artificially diverted</span></em> from these
          little intimate things. Priests and teachers, and the sublime
          ambition of all idealists, coarser and subtler, din it even into
          the child's ears that the means of serving mankind at large depend
          upon altogether different <em><span>things</span></em>—upon the salvation of the
          soul, the service of the State, the advancement of science, or even
          upon social position and property; whereas the needs of the
          individual, his requirements great and small during the twenty-four
          hours of the day, are quite paltry or indifferent.—Even Socrates
          attacked with all his might this arrogant neglect of the human for
          the benefit of humanity, and loved to indicate by a quotation from
          Homer the true sphere and conception of all anxiety and reflection:
          <span>“All that really matters,”</span> he said,
          <span>“is the good and evil hap I find at
          home.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>7.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Two Means of
          Consolation.</span></span>—Epicurus, the soul-comforter of later
          antiquity, said, with that marvellous insight which to this very
          day is so rarely to be found, that for the calming of the spirit
          the solution of the final and ultimate theoretical problems is by
          no means necessary. Hence, instead of raising a barren and remote
          discussion of the final question, whether the Gods existed, it
          sufficed him to say to those who were tormented by <span>“fear of the Gods”</span>: <span>“If
          there are Gods, they do not concern themselves with us.”</span> The
          latter position is far stronger and more favourable, for, by conceding a few
          points to the other, one makes him readier to listen and to take to
          heart. But as soon as he sets about proving the opposite (that the
          Gods do concern themselves with us), into what thorny jungles of
          error must the poor man fall, quite of his own accord, and without
          any cunning on the part of his interlocutor! The latter must only
          have enough subtlety and humanity to conceal his sympathy with this
          tragedy. Finally, the other comes to feel disgust—the strongest
          argument against any proposition—disgust with his own hypothesis.
          He becomes cold, and goes away in the same frame of mind as the
          pure atheist who says, <span>“What do the Gods
          matter to me? The devil take them!”</span>—In other cases,
          especially when a half-physical, half-moral assumption had cast a
          gloom over his spirit, Epicurus did not refute the assumption. He
          agreed that it might be true, but that there was <em><span>a second
          assumption</span></em> to explain the same phenomenon, and that it
          could perhaps be maintained in other ways. The plurality of
          hypotheses (for example, that concerning the origin of
          conscientious scruples) suffices even in our time to remove from
          the soul the shadows that arise so easily from pondering over a
          hypothesis which is isolated, merely visible, and hence overvalued
          a hundredfold.—Thus whoever wishes to console the unfortunate, the
          criminal, the hypochondriac, the dying, may call to mind the two
          soothing suggestions of Epicurus, which can be applied to a great
          number of problems. In their simplest form they would run: firstly,
          granted the thing is so, it does not concern us; secondly, the
          thing may be so, but it may also be otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>8.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>In the
          Night.</span></span>—So soon as night begins to fall our sensations
          concerning everyday matters are altered. There is the wind,
          prowling as if on forbidden paths, whispering as if in search of
          something, fretting because he cannot find it. There is the
          lamplight, with its dim red glow, its weary look, unwillingly
          fighting against night, a sullen slave to wakeful man. There are
          the breathings of the sleeper, with their terrible rhythm, to which
          an ever-recurring care seems to blow the trumpet-melody—we do not
          hear it, but when the sleeper's bosom heaves we feel our
          heart-strings tighten; and when the breath sinks and almost dies
          away into a deathly stillness, we say to ourselves, <span>“Rest awhile, poor troubled spirit!”</span> All living
          creatures bear so great a burden that we wish them an eternal rest;
          night invites to death.—If human beings were deprived of the sun
          and resisted night by means of moonlight and oil-lamps, what a
          philosophy would cast its veil over them! We already see only too
          plainly how a shadow is thrown over the spiritual and intellectual
          nature of man by that moiety of darkness and sunlessness that
          envelops life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>9.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Origin of the
          Doctrine of Free Will.</span></span>—Necessity sways one man in the
          shape of his passions, another as a habit of hearing and obeying, a
          third as a logical conscience, a fourth as a caprice and a
          mischievous delight in evasions. These four, however, seek the freedom of their will
          at the very point where they are most securely fettered. It is as
          if the silkworm sought freedom of will in spinning. What is the
          reason? Clearly this, that every one thinks himself most free where
          his vitality is strongest; hence, as I have said, now in passion,
          now in duty, now in knowledge, now in caprice. A man unconsciously
          imagines that where he is strong, where he feels most thoroughly
          alive, the element of his freedom must lie. He thinks of dependence
          and apathy, independence and vivacity as forming inevitable
          pairs.—Thus an experience that a man has undergone in the social
          and political sphere is wrongly transferred to the ultimate
          metaphysical sphere. There the strong man is also the free man,
          there the vivid feeling of joy and sorrow, the high hopes, the keen
          desires, the powerful hates are the attributes of the ruling,
          independent natures, while the thrall and the slave live in a state
          of dazed oppression.—The doctrine of free will is an invention of
          the ruling classes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>10.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Absence of
          Feeling of New Chains.</span></span>—So long as we do not feel that
          we are in some way dependent, we consider ourselves independent—a
          false conclusion that shows how proud man is, how eager for
          dominion. For he hereby assumes that he would always be sure to
          observe and recognise dependence so soon as he suffered it, the
          preliminary hypothesis being that he generally lives in
          independence, and that, should he lose that independence for once
          in a way, he would immediately detect a contrary
          sensation.—Suppose, however, the reverse to be true—that he is always living in a
          complex state of dependence, but thinks himself free where, through
          long habit, he no longer feels the weight of the chain? He only
          suffers from new chains, and <span>“free
          will”</span> really means nothing more than an absence of feeling
          of new chains.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>11.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Freedom of the
          Will and the Isolation of Facts.</span></span>—Our ordinary
          inaccurate observation takes a group of phenomena as one and calls
          them a fact. Between this fact and another we imagine a vacuum, we
          isolate each fact. In reality, however, the sum of our actions and
          cognitions is no series of facts and intervening vacua, but a
          continuous stream. Now the belief in free will is incompatible with
          the idea of a continuous, uniform, undivided, indivisible flow.
          This belief presupposes that every single action is isolated and
          indivisible; it is an atomic theory as regards volition and
          cognition.—We misunderstand facts as we misunderstand characters,
          speaking of similar characters and similar facts, whereas both are
          non-existent. Further, we bestow praise and blame only on this
          false hypothesis, that there are similar facts, that a graduated
          order of species of facts exists, corresponding to a graduated
          order of values. Thus we isolate not only the single fact, but the
          groups of apparently equal facts (good, evil, compassionate,
          envious actions, and so forth). In both cases we are wrong.—The
          word and the concept are the most obvious reason for our belief in
          this isolation of groups of actions. We do not merely thereby designate the things;
          the thought at the back of our minds is that by the word and the
          concept we can grasp the essence of the actions. We are still
          constantly led astray by words and actions, and are induced to
          think of things as simpler than they are, as separate, indivisible,
          existing in the absolute. Language contains a hidden philosophical
          mythology, which, however careful we may be, breaks out afresh at
          every moment. The belief in free will—that is to say, in similar
          facts and isolated facts—finds in language its continual apostle
          and advocate.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>12.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Fundamental
          Errors.</span></span>—A man cannot feel any psychical pleasure or
          pain unless he is swayed by one of two illusions. Either he
          believes in the identity of certain facts, certain sensations, and
          in that case finds spiritual pleasure and pain in comparing present
          with past conditions and in noting their similarity or difference
          (as is invariably the case with recollection); or he believes in
          the freedom of the will, perhaps when he reflects, <span>“I ought not to have done this,”</span> <span>“This might have turned out differently,”</span> and
          from these reflections likewise he derives pleasure and pain.
          Without the errors that are rife in every psychical pain and
          pleasure, humanity would never have developed. For the root idea of
          humanity is that man is free in a world of bondage—man, the eternal
          wonder-worker, whether his deeds be good or evil—man, the amazing

<p><span><span>Man as the

          more intellectual than men to relish to the full the humorous side
          of man's view of himself as the goal of all existence and of his
          serious pronouncement that he is satisfied only with the prospect
          of fulfilling a world-mission. If a God created the world, he
          created man to be his ape, as a perpetual source of amusement in
          the midst of his rather tedious eternities. The music of the
          spheres surrounding the world would then presumably be the mocking
          laughter of all the other creatures around mankind. God in his
          boredom uses pain for the tickling of his favourite animal, in
          order to enjoy his proudly tragic gestures and expressions of
          suffering, and, in general, the intellectual inventiveness of the
          vainest of his creatures—as inventor of this inventor. For he who
          invented man as a joke had more intellect and more joy in intellect
          than has man.—Even here, where our human nature is willing to
          humble itself, our vanity again plays us a trick, in that we men
          should like in this vanity at least to be quite marvellous and
          incomparable. Our uniqueness in the world! Oh, what an improbable
          thing it is! Astronomers, who occasionally acquire a horizon
          outside our world, give us to understand that the drop of life on
          the earth is without significance for the total character of the
          mighty ocean of birth and decay; that countless stars present
          conditions for the generation of life similar to those of the
          earth—and yet these are but a handful in comparison with the
          endless number that have never known, or have long been cured, of
          the eruption of life; that life on each of these stars, measured by
          the period of its existence, has been but an instant, a flicker,
          with long, long intervals afterwards—and thus in no way the aim and
          final purpose of their existence. Possibly the ant in the forest is
          quite as firmly convinced that it is the aim and purpose of the
          existence of the forest, as we are convinced in our imaginations
          (almost unconsciously) that the destruction of mankind involves the
          destruction of the world. It is even modesty on our part to go no
          farther than this, and not to arrange a universal twilight of the
          world and the Gods as the funeral ceremony of the last man. Even to
          the eye of the most unbiassed astronomer a lifeless world can
          scarcely appear otherwise than as a shining and swinging star
          wherein man lies buried.</p>

<p><span><span>Where
          Indifference is Necessary.</span></span>—Nothing would be more
          perverse than to wait for the truths that science will finally
          establish concerning the first and last things, and until then to
          think (and especially to believe) in the traditional way, as one is
          so often advised to do. The impulse that bids us seek nothing but
          <em><span>certainties</span></em> in this domain is a
          religious offshoot, nothing better—a hidden and only apparently
          sceptical variety of the <span>“metaphysical
          need,”</span> the underlying idea being that for a long time no
          view of these ultimate certainties will be obtainable, and that
          until then the <span>“believer”</span> has the
          right not to trouble himself about the whole subject. We have no
          need of these certainties about the farthermost horizons in order
          to live a full and efficient human life, any more than the ant
          needs them in order to be a good ant. Rather must we ascertain the
          origin of that troublesome significance that we have attached to
          these things for so long. For this we require the history of
          ethical and religious sentiments, since it is only under the
          influence of such sentiments that these most acute problems of
          knowledge have become so weighty and terrifying. Into the outermost
          regions to which the mental eye can penetrate (without ever
          penetrating <em><span>into</span></em> them), we have smuggled such
          concepts as guilt and punishment (everlasting punishment, too!).
          The darker those regions, the more careless we have been. For ages
          men have let their imaginations run riot where they could establish nothing, and have
          induced posterity to accept these fantasies as something serious
          and true, with this abominable lie as their final trump-card: that
          faith is worth more than knowledge. What we need now in regard to
          these ultimate things is not knowledge as against faith, but
          indifference as against faith and pretended knowledge in these
          matters!—Everything must lie nearer to us than what has hitherto
          been preached to us as the most important thing, I mean the
          questions: <span>“What end does man
          serve?”</span> <span>“What is his fate after
          death?”</span> <span>“How does he make his peace
          with God?”</span> and all the rest of that bag of tricks. The
          problems of the dogmatic philosophers, be they idealists,
          materialists, or realists, concern us as little as do these
          religious questions. They all have the same object in view—to force
          us to a decision in matters where neither faith nor knowledge is
          needed. It is better even for the most ardent lover of knowledge
          that the territory open to investigation and to reason should be
          encircled by a belt of fog-laden, treacherous marshland, a strip of
          ever watery, impenetrable, and indeterminable country. It is just
          by the comparison with the realm of darkness on the edge of the
          world of knowledge that the bright, accessible region of that world
          rises in value.—We must once more become good friends of the
          <span>“everyday matters,”</span> and not, as
          hitherto, despise them and look beyond them at clouds and monsters
          of the night. In forests and caverns, in marshy tracts and under
          dull skies, on the lowest rungs of the ladder of culture, man has
          lived for æons, and lived in poverty. There he has learnt to
          despise the present, his neighbours, his life, and himself, and we, the
          inhabitants of the brighter fields of Nature and mind, still
          inherit in our blood some taint of this contempt for everyday
          matters.</p>

<p><span><span>Profound
          Interpretations.</span></span>—He who has interpreted a passage in
          an author <span>“more profoundly”</span> than was
          intended, has not interpreted the author but has obscured him. Our
          metaphysicians are in the same relation, or even in a worse
          relation, to the text of Nature. For, to apply their profound
          interpretations, they often alter the text to suit their
          purpose—or, in other words, corrupt the text. A curious example of
          the corruption and obscuration of an author's text is furnished by
          the ideas of Schopenhauer on the pregnancy of women. <span>“The sign of a continuous will to life in time,”</span>
          he says, <span>“is copulation; the sign of the
          light of knowledge which is associated anew with this will and
          holds the possibility of a deliverance, and that too in the highest
          degree of clearness, is the renewed incarnation of the will to
          life. This incarnation is betokened by pregnancy, which is
          therefore frank and open, and even proud, whereas copulation hides
          itself like a criminal.”</span> He declares that every woman, if
          surprised in the sexual act, would be likely to die of shame, but
          <span>“displays her pregnancy without a trace of
          shame, nay even with a sort of pride.”</span> Now, firstly, this
          condition cannot easily be displayed more aggressively than it
          displays itself, and when Schopenhauer gives prominence only to the intentional character of
          the display, he is fashioning his text to suit the interpretation.
          Moreover, his statement of the universality of the phenomenon is
          not true. He speaks of <span>“every
          woman.”</span> Many women, especially the younger, often appear
          painfully ashamed of their condition, even in the presence of their
          nearest kinsfolk. And when women of riper years, especially in the
          humbler classes, do actually appear proud of their condition, it is
          because they would give us to understand that they are still
          desirable to their husbands. That a neighbour on seeing them or a
          passing stranger should say or think <span>“Can
          it be possible?”</span>—that is an alms always acceptable to the
          vanity of women of low mental capacity. In the reverse instance, to
          conclude from Schopenhauer's proposition, the cleverest and most
          intelligent women would tend more than any to exult openly in their
          condition. For they have the best prospect of giving birth to an
          intellectual prodigy, in whom <span>“the
          will”</span> can once more <span>“negative”</span> itself for the universal good. Stupid
          women, on the other hand, would have every reason to hide their
          pregnancy more modestly than anything they hide.—It cannot be said
          that this view corresponds to reality. Granted, however, that
          Schopenhauer was right on the general principle that women show
          more self-satisfaction when pregnant than at any other time, a
          better explanation than this lies to hand. One might imagine the
          clucking of a hen even before she lays an egg, saying, <span>“Look! look! I shall lay an egg! I shall lay an
          egg!”</span></p>

          in order that we may know more, judge better, live better, not in
          order that all the world may dissect. Unfortunately, men still
          think that every moralist in his every action must be a pattern for
          others to imitate. They confound him with the preacher of morality.
          The older moralists did not dissect enough and preached too often,

<p><span><span>A Caution

          strong, noble, self-denying attitude of such beings as the heroes
          of Plutarch, or the pure, enlightened, warmth-giving state of soul
          peculiar to truly good men and women, as difficult scientific
          problems. They investigate the origin of such phenomena, indicating
          the complex element in the apparent simplicity, and directing their
          gaze to the tangled skein of motives, the delicate web of
          conceptual illusions, and the sentiments of individuals or of
          groups, that are a legacy of ancient days gradually increased. Such moralists are
          very different from those with whom they are most commonly
          confounded, from those petty minds that do not believe at all in
          these modes of thought and states of soul, and imagine their own
          poverty to be hidden somewhere behind the glamour of greatness and
          purity. The moralists say, <span>“Here are
          problems,”</span> and these pitiable creatures say, <span>“Here are impostors and deceptions.”</span> Thus the
          latter deny the existence of the very things which the former are

<p><span><span>Man as the

          discovered measure and measuring, scales and weighing (for the word
          <span><span>Mensch</span></span> [man] means <span>“the measurer”</span>—he wished to <em><span>name</span></em>
          himself after his greatest discovery!). With these ideas they
          mounted into regions that are quite beyond all measuring and
          weighing, but did not appear to be so in the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>22.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Principle of
          Equilibrium.</span></span>—The robber and the man of power who
          promises to protect a community from robbers are perhaps at bottom
          beings of the same mould, save that the latter attains his ends by
          other means than the former—that is to say, through regular imposts
          paid to him by the community, and no longer through forced
          contributions. (The same relation exists between merchant and pirate, who for a long
          period are one and the same person: where the one function appears
          to them inadvisable, they exercise the other. Even to-day
          mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement on piratical
          morality—buying in the cheapest market, at prime cost if possible,
          and selling in the dearest.) The essential point is that the man of
          power promises to maintain the equilibrium against the robber, and
          herein the weak find a possibility of living. For either they must
          group themselves into an equivalent power, or they must subject
          themselves to some one of equivalent power (<span><span>i.e.</span></span>
          render service in return for his efforts). The latter course is
          generally preferred, because it really keeps two dangerous beings
          in check—the robber through the man of power, and the man of power
          through the standpoint of advantage; for the latter profits by
          treating his subjects with graciousness and tolerance, in order
          that they may support not only themselves but their ruler. As a
          matter of fact, conditions may still be hard and cruel enough, yet
          in comparison with the complete annihilation that was formerly
          always a possibility, men breathe freely.—The community is at first
          the organisation of the weak to counterbalance menacing forces. An
          organisation to outweigh those forces would be more advisable, if
          its members grew strong enough to destroy the adverse power: and
          when it is a question of one mighty oppressor, the <em><span>attempt
          will</span></em> certainly be made. But if the one man is the head
          of a clan, or if he has a large following, a rapid and decisive
          annihilation is improbable, and a long or permanent feud is only to
          be expected. This feud, however, involves the least desirable condition for the community,
          for it thereby loses the time to provide for its means of
          subsistence with the necessary regularity, and sees the product of
          all work hourly threatened. Hence the community prefers to raise
          its power of attack and defence to the exact plane on which the
          power of its dangerous neighbour stands, and to give him to
          understand that an equal weight now lies in its own side of the
          scales—so why not be good friends?—Thus equilibrium is a most
          important conception for the understanding of the ancient doctrines
          of law and morals. Equilibrium is, in fact, the basis of justice.
          When justice in ruder ages says, <span>“An eye
          for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,”</span> it presupposes the
          attainment of this equilibrium and tries to maintain it by means of
          this compensation; so that, when crime is committed, the injured
          party will not take the revenge of blind anger. By means of the
          <span><span>jus talionis</span></span> the equilibrium of
          the disturbed relations of power is restored, for in such primitive
          times an eye or an arm more means a bit more power, more weight. In
          a community where all consider themselves equal, disgrace and
          punishment await crime—that is, violations of the principle of
          equilibrium. Disgrace is thrown into the scale as a counter-weight
          against the encroaching individual, who has gained profit by his
          encroachment, and now suffers losses (through disgrace) which annul
          and outweigh the previous profits. Punishment, in the same way,
          sets up a far greater counter-weight against the preponderance
          which every criminal hopes to obtain—imprisonment as against a deed
          of violence, restitution and fines as against theft. Thus the sinner is reminded that his
          action has excluded him from the community and from its moral
          advantages, since the community treats him as an inferior, a weaker
          brother, an outsider. For this reason punishment is not merely
          retaliation, but has something more, something of the cruelty of
          the state of nature, and of this it would serve as a reminder.</p>

<p><span><span>Whether the
          Adherents of the Doctrine of Free Will have a Right to
          Punish?</span></span>—Men whose vocation it is to judge and punish
          try to establish in every case whether an evil-doer is really
          responsible for his act, whether he was able to apply his reasoning
          powers, whether he acted with motives and not unconsciously or
          under constraint. If he is punished, it is because he preferred the
          worse to the better motives, which he must consequently have known.
          Where this knowledge is wanting, man is, according to the
          prevailing view, not responsible—unless his ignorance, <span><span>e.g.</span></span>
          his <span><span>ignorantia
          legis</span></span>, be the consequence of an intentional neglect
          to learn what he ought: in that case he already preferred the worse
          to the better motives at the time when he refused to learn, and
          must now pay the penalty of his unwise choice. If, on the other
          hand, perhaps through stupidity or shortsightedness, he has never
          seen the better motives, he is generally not punished, for people
          say that he made a wrong choice, he acted like a brute beast. The
          intentional rejection of the better reason is now needed before we
          treat the offender
          as fit to be punished. But how can any one be intentionally more
          unreasonable than he ought to be? Whence comes the decision, if the
          scales are loaded with good and bad motives? So the origin is not
          error or blindness, not an internal or external constraint? (It
          should furthermore be remembered that every so-called <span>“external constraint”</span> is nothing more than the
          internal constraint of fear and pain.) Whence? is the repeated
          question. So reason is not to be the cause of action, because
          reason cannot decide against the better motives? Thus we call
          <span>“free will”</span> to our aid. Absolute
          discretion is to decide, and a moment is to intervene when no
          motive exercises an influence, when the deed is done as a miracle,
          resulting from nothing. This assumed discretion is punished in a
          case where no discretion should rule. Reason, which knows law,
          prohibition, and command, should have left no choice, they say, and
          should have acted as a constraint and a higher power. Hence the
          offender is punished because he makes use of <span>“free will”</span>—in other words, has acted without
          motive where he should have been guided by motives. But why did he
          do it? This question must not even be asked; the deed was done
          without a <span>“Why?”</span> without motive,
          without origin, being a thing purposeless, unreasoned.—However,
          according to the above-named preliminary condition of
          punishability, such a deed should not be punished at all! Moreover,
          even this reason for punishing should not hold good, that in this
          case something had <em><span>not</span></em> been done, had been omitted,
          that reason had not been used at all: for at any rate the omission
          was unintentional, and only intentional omission is considered punishable. The
          offender has indeed preferred the worse to the better motives, but
          without motive and purpose: he has indeed failed to apply his
          reason, but not exactly with the object of not applying it. The
          very assumption made in the case of punishable crime, that the
          criminal intentionally renounced his reason, is removed by the
          hypothesis of <span>“free will.”</span> According
          to your own principles, you must not punish, you adherents of the
          doctrine of free will!—These principles are, however, nothing but a
          very marvellous conceptual mythology, and the hen that hatched them
          has brooded on her eggs far away from all reality.</p>

          His punishment, however, is measured by the degree of astonishment
          that seizes the judge when he finds the crime incomprehensible.—If
          the defending counsel's knowledge of the case and its previous
          history extends far enough, the so-called extenuating circumstances
          which he duly pleads must end by absolving his client from all
          guilt. Or, to put it more plainly, the advocate will, step by step,
          tone down and finally remove the astonishment of the judge, by
          forcing every honest listener to the tacit avowal, <span>“He was bound to act as he did, and if we punished, we

          punishment by the degree of knowledge we possess or can obtain of the previous
          history of the crime—is that not in conflict with all equity?</p>

<p><span><span>Exchange and
          Equity.</span></span>—In an exchange, the only just and honest
          course would be for either party to demand only so much as he
          considers his commodity to be worth, allowance being made for
          trouble in acquisition, scarcity, time spent and so forth, besides
          the subjective value. As soon as you make your price bear a
          relation to the other's need, you become a refined sort of robber
          and extortioner.—If money is the sole medium of exchange, we must
          remember that a shilling is by no means the same thing in the hands
          of a rich heir, a farm labourer, a merchant, and a university
          student. It would be equitable for every one to receive much or
          little for his money, according as he has done much or little to
          earn it. In practice, as we all know, the reverse is the case. In
          the world of high finance the shilling of the idle rich man can buy
          more than that of the poor, industrious man.</p>

<p><span><span>Legal
          Conditions as Means.</span></span>—Law, where it rests upon
          contracts between equals, holds good so long as the power of the
          parties to the contract remains equal or similar. Wisdom created
          law to end all feuds and useless expenditure among men on an equal
          footing. Quite as definite an end is put to this waste, however,
          when one party has become decidedly weaker than the other. Subjection enters and law
          ceases, but the result is the same as that attained by law. For now
          it is the wisdom of the superior which advises to spare the
          inferior and not uselessly to squander his strength. Thus the
          position of the inferior is often more favourable than that of the
          equal.—Hence legal conditions are temporary <em><span>means</span></em>
          counselled by wisdom, and not ends.</p>

<p><span><span>Explanation of
          Malicious Joy.</span></span>—Malicious joy arises when a man
          consciously finds himself in evil plight and feels anxiety or
          remorse or pain. The misfortune that overtakes B. makes him equal
          to A., and A. is reconciled and no longer envious.—If A. is
          prosperous, he still hoards up in his memory B.'s misfortune as a
          capital, so as to throw it in the scale as a counter-weight when he
          himself suffers adversity. In this case too he feels <span>“malicious joy”</span> (<span><span>Schadenfreude</span></span>). The sentiment of
          equality thus applies its standard to the domain of luck and
          chance. Malicious joy is the commonest expression of victory and
          restoration of equality, even in a higher state of civilisation.
          This emotion has only been in existence since the time when man
          learnt to look upon another as his equal—in other words, since the
          foundation of society.</p>

<p><span><span>The Arbitrary
          Element in the Award of Punishment.</span></span>—To most criminals
          punishment comes just as illegitimate children come to women. They have done
          the same thing a hundred times without any bad consequences.
          Suddenly comes discovery, and with discovery punishment. Yet habit
          should make the deed for which the criminal is punished appear more
          excusable, for he has developed a propensity that is hard to
          resist. Instead of this, the criminal is punished more severely if
          the suspicion of habitual crime rests on him, and habit is made a
          valid reason against all extenuation. On the other hand, a model
          life, wherein crime shows up in more terrible contrast, should make
          the guilt appear more heavy! But here the custom is to soften the
          punishment. Everything is measured not from the standpoint of the
          criminal but from that of society and its losses and dangers. The
          previous utility of an individual is weighed against his one
          nefarious action, his previous criminality is added to that
          recently discovered, and punishment is thus meted out as highly as
          possible. But if we thus punish or reward a man's past (for in the
          former case the diminution of punishment is a reward) we ought to
          go farther back and punish and reward the cause of his past—I mean
          parents, teachers, society. In many instances we shall then find
          the <em><span>judges</span></em> somehow or other sharing in
          the guilt. It is arbitrary to stop at the criminal himself when we
          punish his past: if we will not grant the absolute excusability of
          every crime, we should stop at each individual case and probe no
          farther into the past—in other words, isolate guilt and not connect
          it with previous actions. Otherwise we sin against logic. The teachers of free will should
          draw the inevitable conclusion from their doctrine of <span>“free will”</span> and boldly decree: <span>“No action has a past.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Envy and her
          Nobler Sister.</span></span>—Where equality is really recognised
          and permanently established, we see the rise of that propensity
          that is generally considered immoral, and would scarcely be
          conceivable in a state of nature—envy. The envious man is
          susceptible to every sign of individual superiority to the common
          herd, and wishes to depress every one once more to the level—or
          raise himself to the superior plane. Hence arise two different
          modes of action, which Hesiod designated good and bad Eris. In the
          same way, in a condition of equality there arises indignation if A.
          is prosperous above and B. unfortunate beneath their deserts and
          equality. These latter, however, are emotions of nobler natures.
          They feel the want of justice and equity in things that are
          independent of the arbitrary choice of men—or, in other words, they
          desire the equality recognised by man to be recognised as well by
          Nature and chance. They are angry that men of equal merits should
          not have equal fortune.</p>

<p><span><span>The Envy of the

          equality with his superior (like Ajax), or is made equal with him
          by the favour of fortune (like Niobe, the too favoured mother). In the social class system
          this envy demands that no one shall have merits above his station,
          that his prosperity shall be on a level with his position, and
          especially that his self-consciousness shall not outgrow the limits
          of his rank. Often the victorious general, or the pupil who
          achieves a masterpiece, has experienced <span>“the envy of the gods.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Vanity as an
          Anti-Social Aftergrowth.</span></span>—As men, for the sake of
          security, have made themselves equal in order to found communities,
          but as also this conception is imposed by a sort of constraint and
          is entirely opposed to the instincts of the individual, so, the
          more universal security is guaranteed, the more do new offshoots of
          the old instinct for predominance appear. Such offshoots appear in
          the setting-up of class distinctions, in the demand for
          professional dignities and privileges, and, generally speaking, in
          vanity (manners, dress, speech, and so forth). So soon as danger to
          the community is apparent, the majority, who were unable to assert
          their preponderance in a time of universal peace, once more bring
          about the condition of equality, and for the time being the absurd
          privileges and vanities disappear. If the community, however,
          collapses utterly and anarchy reigns supreme, there arises the
          state of nature: an absolutely ruthless inequality as recounted by
          Thucydides in the case of Corcyra. Neither a natural justice nor a
          natural injustice exists.</p>

          of the principle of equilibrium is applied to cases where nothing
          is prescribed by law. Equity looks forwards and backwards, its
          maxim being, <span>“Do unto others as you would
          that they should do unto you.”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span>Aequum</span></span> means: <span>“This principle is conformable to our equality; it
          tones down even our small differences to an appearance of equality,
          and expects us to be indulgent in cases where we are not compelled
          to pardon.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Elements of
          Revenge.</span></span>—The word <span>“revenge”</span> is spoken so quickly that it almost
          seems as if it could not contain more than one conceptual and
          emotional root. Hence we are still at pains to find this root. Our
          economists, in the same way, have never wearied of scenting a
          similar unity in the word <span>“value,”</span>
          and of hunting after the primitive root idea of value. As if all
          words were not pockets, into which this or that or several things
          have been stuffed at once! So <span>“revenge”</span> is now one thing, now another, and
          sometimes more composite. Let us first distinguish that defensive
          counter-blow, which we strike, almost unconsciously, even at
          inanimate objects (such as machinery in motion) that have hurt us.
          The notion is to set a check to the object that has hurt us, by
          bringing the machine to a stop. Sometimes the force of this counter-blow, in order to attain
          its object, will have to be strong enough to shatter the machine.
          If the machine be too strong to be disorganised by one man, the
          latter will all the same strike the most violent blow he can—as a
          sort of last attempt. We behave similarly towards persons who hurt
          us, at the immediate sensation of the hurt. If we like to call this
          an act of revenge, well and good: but we must remember that here
          self-preservation alone has set its cog-wheels of reason in motion,
          and that after all we do not think of the doer of the injury but
          only of ourselves. We act without any idea of doing injury in
          return, only with a view to getting away safe and sound.—It needs
          time to pass in thought from oneself to one's adversary and ask
          oneself at what point he is most vulnerable. This is done in the
          second variety of revenge, the preliminary idea of which is to
          consider the vulnerability and susceptibility of the other. The
          intention then is to give pain. On the other hand, the idea of
          securing himself against further injury is in this case so entirely
          outside the avenger's horizon, that he almost regularly brings
          about his own further injury and often foresees it in cold blood.
          If in the first sort of revenge it was the fear of a second blow
          that made the counter-blow as strong as possible, in this case
          there is an almost complete indifference to what one's adversary
          will do: the strength of the counter-blow is only determined by
          what he has <em><span>already</span></em> done to us. Then what has
          he done? What profit is it to us if he is now suffering, after we
          have suffered through him? This is a case of readjustment, whereas
          the first act of revenge
          only serves the purpose of self-preservation. It may be that
          through our adversary we have lost property, rank, friends,
          children—these losses are not recovered by revenge, the
          readjustment only concerns a subsidiary loss which is added to all
          the other losses. The revenge of readjustment does not preserve one
          from further injury, it does not make good the injury already
          suffered—except in one case. If our honour has suffered through our
          adversary, revenge can restore it. But in any case honour
          <em><span>has</span></em> suffered an injury if
          intentional harm has been done us, because our adversary proved
          thereby that he was not afraid of us. By revenge we prove that we
          are not afraid of him either, and herein lies the settlement, the
          readjustment. (The intention of showing their complete lack of fear
          goes so far in some people that the dangers of revenge—loss of
          health or life or other losses—are in their eyes an indispensable
          condition of every vengeful act. Hence they practise the duel,
          although the law also offers them aid in obtaining satisfaction for
          what they have suffered. They are not satisfied with a safe means
          of recovering their honour, because this would not prove their
          fearlessness.)—In the first-named variety of revenge it is just
          fear that strikes the counter-blow; in the second case it is the
          absence of fear, which, as has been said, wishes to manifest itself
          in the counter-blow.—Thus nothing appears more different than the
          motives of the two courses of action which are designated by the
          one word <span>“revenge.”</span> Yet it often
          happens that the avenger is not precisely certain as to what really
          prompted his deed: perhaps he struck the counterblow from fear and the instinct of
          self-preservation, but in the background, when he has time to
          reflect upon the standpoint of wounded honour, he imagines that he
          has avenged himself for the sake of his honour—this motive is in
          any case more <em><span>reputable</span></em> than the other. An
          essential point is whether he sees his honour injured in the eyes
          of others (the world) or only in the eyes of his offenders: in the
          latter case he will prefer secret, in the former open revenge.
          Accordingly, as he enters strongly or feebly into the soul of the
          doer and the spectator, his revenge will be more bitter or more
          tame. If he is entirely lacking in this sort of imagination, he
          will not think at all of revenge, as the feeling of <span>“honour”</span> is not present in him, and accordingly
          cannot be wounded. In the same way, he will not think of revenge if
          he despises the offender and the spectator; because as objects of
          his contempt they cannot give him honour, and accordingly cannot
          rob him of honour. Finally, he will forego revenge in the not
          uncommon case of his loving the offender. It is true that he then
          suffers loss of honour in the other's eyes, and will perhaps become
          less worthy of having his love returned. But even to renounce all
          requital of love is a sacrifice that love is ready to make when its
          only object is to avoid hurting the beloved object: this would mean
          hurting oneself more than one is hurt by the
          sacrifice.—Accordingly, every one will avenge himself, unless he be
          bereft of honour or inspired by contempt or by love for the
          offender. Even if he turns to the law-courts, he desires revenge as
          a private individual; but also, as a thoughtful, prudent man of
          society, he desires the revenge of society upon one who does not respect it. Thus by legal
          punishment private honour as well as that of society is
          restored—that is to say, punishment is revenge. Punishment
          undoubtedly contains the first-mentioned element of revenge, in as
          far as by its means society helps to preserve itself, and strikes a
          counter-blow in self-defence. Punishment desires to prevent further
          injury, to scare other offenders. In this way the two elements of
          revenge, different as they are, are united in punishment, and this
          may perhaps tend most of all to maintain the above-mentioned
          confusion of ideas, thanks to which the individual avenger
          generally does not know what he really wants.</p>

<p><span><span>The Virtues
          that Damage Us.</span></span>—As members of communities we think we
          have no right to exercise certain virtues which afford us great
          honour and some pleasure as private individuals (for example,
          indulgence and favour towards miscreants of all kinds)—in short,
          every mode of action whereby the advantage of society would suffer
          through our virtue. No bench of judges, face to face with its
          conscience, may permit itself to be gracious. This privilege is
          reserved for the king as an individual, and we are glad when he
          makes use of it, proving that we should like to be gracious
          individually, but not collectively. Society recognises only the
          virtues profitable to her, or at least not injurious to her—virtues
          like justice, which are exercised without loss, or, in fact, at
          compound interest. The virtues that damage us cannot have
          originated in
          society, because even now opposition to them arises in every small
          society that is in the making. Such virtues are therefore those of
          men of unequal standing, invented by the superior individuals; they
          are the virtues of rulers, and the idea underlying them is:
          <span>“I am mighty enough to put up with an
          obvious loss; that is a proof of my power.”</span> Thus they are
          virtues closely akin to pride.</p>

          develop into such unruly monsters that you are frightened now at

          mutually content with the consequences of making an agreement, and,
          again, too indolent formally to renew it. Thus they went on living
          as if it had constantly been renewed, and gradually, when oblivion
          cast its veil over the origin, they thought they possessed a sacred,
          unalterable foundation on which every generation would be compelled
          to build. Tradition was now a constraint, even if it no more
          involved the profit originally derived from making the
          agreement.—Here the weak have always found their strong fortress.
          They are inclined to immortalise the momentary agreement, the

<p><span><span>The
          Significance of Oblivion in Moral Sentiment.</span></span>—The same
          actions that in primitive society first aimed at the common
          advantage were later on performed from other motives: from fear or
          reverence of those who demanded and recommended them; or from
          habit, because men had seen them done about them from childhood
          upwards; or from kindness, because the practising of them caused
          delight and approving looks on all sides; or from vanity, because
          they were praised. Such actions, in which the fundamental motive,
          that of utility, has been <em><span>forgotten</span></em>, are then called moral;
          not, indeed, because they are done from those other motives, but
          because they are not done with a conscious purpose of
          utility.—Whence the hatred of utility that suddenly manifests
          itself here, and by which all praiseworthy actions formally exclude
          all actions for the sake of utility?—Clearly society, the
          rallying-point of all morality and of all maxims in praise of moral
          action, has had to battle too long and too fiercely with the
          selfishness and obstinacy of the individual not to rate every
          motive morally higher than utility. Hence it looks as if morals had not sprung
          from utility, whereas in fact morals are originally the public
          utility, which had great difficulty in prevailing over the
          interests of the unit and securing a loftier reputation.</p>

          inherited from their forefathers their gentle mode of action, but
          not common sense (the source of that mode of action). The pleasant
          thing about this wealth is that one must always bestow and
          communicate a portion of it, if its presence is to be felt at all.
          Thus this wealth unconsciously aims at bridging the gulf between
          the morally rich and the morally poor, and, what is its best and
          most remarkable feature, not for the sake of a future mean between
          rich and poor, but for the sake of a universal prosperity and
          superfluity.—Such may be the prevailing view of inherited moral
          wealth, but it seems to me that this view is maintained more
          <span><span>in majorem gloriam</span></span> of morality
          than in honour of truth. Experience at least establishes a maxim
          which must serve, if not as a refutation, at any rate as an
          important check upon that generalisation. Without the most
          exquisite intelligence, says experience, without the most refined
          capacity for choice and a strong propensity to observe the mean,
          the morally rich will become spendthrifts of morality. For by abandoning themselves without
          restraint to their compassionate, gentle, conciliatory, harmonising
          instincts, they make all about them more careless, more covetous,
          and more sentimental. The children of these highly moral
          spendthrifts easily and (sad to relate) at best become pleasant but
          futile wasters.</p>

<p><span><span>The Judge and
          Extenuating Circumstances.</span></span>—<span>“One should behave as a man of honour even towards the
          devil and pay his debts,”</span> said an old soldier, when the
          story of Faust had been related to him in rather fuller detail.
          <span>“Hell is the right place for Faust!”</span>
<span>“You are terrible, you men!”</span> cried
          his wife; <span>“how can that be? After all, his
          only fault was having no ink in his ink-stand! It is indeed a sin

          not to burn in Hell-fire?”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Problem of the
          Duty of Truth.</span></span>—Duty is an imperious sentiment that
          forces us to action. We call it good, and consider it outside the
          pale of discussion. The origin, limits, and justification of duty
          we will not debate or allow to be debated. But the thinker
          considers everything an evolution and every evolution a subject for
          discussion, and is accordingly without duty so long as he is merely
          a thinker. As such, he would not recognise the duty of seeing and
          speaking the truth; he would not <em><span>feel</span></em>
          the sentiment at all. He asks, whence comes it and whither will it
          go? But even this questioning appears to him questionable. Surely, however, the
          consequence would be that the thinker's machinery would no longer
          work properly if he could really feel himself unencumbered by duty
          in the search for knowledge? It would appear, then, that for fuel
          the same element is necessary as must be investigated by means of
          the machine.—Perhaps the formula will be: granted there were a duty
          of recognising truth, what is then the truth in regard to every
          other kind of duty?—But is not a hypothetical sense of duty a
          contradiction in terms?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>44.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Grades of
          Morals.</span></span>—Morality is primarily a means of preserving
          the community and saving it from destruction. Next it is a means of
          maintaining the community on a certain plane and in a certain
          degree of benevolence. Its motives are fear and hope, and these in
          a more coarse, rough, and powerful form, the more the propensity
          towards the perverse, one-sided, and personal still persists. The
          most terrible means of intimidation must be brought into play so
          long as milder forms have no effect and that twofold species of
          preservation cannot be attained. (The strongest intimidation, by
          the way, is the invention of a hereafter with a hell everlasting.)
          For this purpose we must have racks and torturers of the soul.
          Further grades of morality, and accordingly means to the end
          referred to, are the commandments of a God (as in the Mosaic law).
          Still further and higher are the commandments of an absolute sense
          of duty with a <span>“Thou shalt”</span>—all rather roughly hewn
          yet <em><span>broad</span></em> steps, because on the finer,
          narrower steps men cannot yet set their feet. Then comes a morality
          of inclination, of taste, finally of insight—which is beyond all
          the illusory motives of morality, but has convinced itself that
          humanity for long periods could be allowed no other.</p>

          things great and small, unconsciously come to glorify the good,
          compassionate, benevolent impulses of that instinctive morality
          which has no head, but seems merely to consist of a heart and
          helpful hands. It is to their interest even to cast suspicion upon
          a morality of reason and to set up the other as the sole

<p><span><span>Prohibitions

          we do not understand or admit, is almost a command, not only for
          the stiff-necked but for the thirster after knowledge. We at once
          make an experiment in order to learn <em><span>why</span></em> the
          prohibition was made. Moral prohibitions, like those of the
          Decalogue, are only suited to ages when reason lies vanquished.
          Nowadays a prohibition like <span>“Thou shalt not
          kill,”</span> <span>“Thou shalt not commit
          adultery,”</span> laid down without reasons, would have an

<span>50.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Pity and

          <em><span>fear</span></em> as soon as one becomes an
          object of pity. One has sunk below the level of the equilibrium.
          For this equilibrium does not satisfy human vanity, which is only
          satisfied by the feeling that one is imposing respect and awe. Hence it is
          difficult to explain why pity is so highly prized, just as we need
          to explain why the unselfish man, who is originally despised or
          feared as being artful, is praised.</p>

          adults have grown up beyond them and have to stoop to them. I think
          the grasses hate us when we confess our love for them.—He who would

<h2>
<span>52.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Sum-Total

          that has regularly been demanded of us, without reason, in the days
          of our childhood, by people whom we respected or feared. From
          conscience comes that feeling of obligation (<span>“This I must do, this omit”</span>) which does not ask,
          Why must I?—In all cases where a thing is done with <span>“because”</span> and <span>“why,”</span> man acts without conscience, but not
          necessarily on that account <em><span>against</span></em> conscience.—The belief in
          authority is the source of conscience; which is therefore not the
          voice of God in the heart of man, but the voice of some men in
          man.</p>

          over bogs and forests. To sow the seed of spiritual good works on
          the soil of the vanquished passions is the next and most urgent
          task. The conquest itself is a means, not an end: if it be not so
          regarded, all kind of weeds and devil's crop quickly spring up upon
          the fertile soil that has been cleared, and soon the growth is all

<h2>
<span>57.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Intercourse
          with Animals.</span></span>—The origin of our morality may still be
          observed in our relations with animals. Where advantage or the reverse do not come into play,
          we have a feeling of complete irresponsibility. For example, we
          kill or wound insects or let them live, and as a rule think no more
          about it. We are so clumsy that even our gracious acts towards
          flowers and small animals are almost always murderous: this does
          not in the least detract from our pleasure in them.—To-day is the
          festival of the small animals, the most sultry day of the year.
          There is a swarming and crawling around us, and we, without
          intention, but also without reflection, crush here and there a
          little fly or winged beetle.—If animals do us harm, we strive to
          <em><span>annihilate</span></em> them in every possible
          way. The means are often cruel enough, even without our really
          intending them to be so—it is the cruelty of thoughtlessness. If
          they are useful, we turn them to advantage, until a more refined
          wisdom teaches us that certain animals amply reward a different
          mode of treatment, that of tending and breeding. Here
          responsibility first arises. Torturing is avoided in the case of
          the domestic animal. One man is indignant if another is cruel to
          his cow, quite in accordance with the primitive communal morality,
          which sees the commonwealth in danger whenever an individual does
          wrong. He who perceives any transgression in the community fears
          indirect harm to himself. Thus we fear in this case for the quality
          of meat, agriculture, and means of communication if we see the
          domestic animals ill-treated. Moreover, he who is harsh to animals
          awakens a suspicion that he is also harsh to men who are weak,
          inferior, and incapable of revenge. He is held to be ignoble
          and deficient in the
          finer form of pride. Thus arises a foundation of moral judgments
          and sentiments, but the greatest contribution is made by
          superstition. Many animals incite men by glances, tones, and
          gestures to transfer themselves into them in imagination, and some
          religions teach us, under certain circumstances, to see in animals
          the dwelling-place of human and divine souls: whence they recommend
          a nobler caution or even a reverential awe in intercourse with
          animals. Even after the disappearance of this superstition the
          sentiments awakened by it continue to exercise their influence, to
          ripen and to blossom.—Christianity, as is well known, has shown
          itself in this respect a poor and retrograde religion.</p>

<p><span><span>New
          Actors.</span></span>—Among human beings there is no greater
          banality than death. Second in order, because it is possible to die
          without being born, comes birth, and next comes marriage. But these
          hackneyed little tragi-comedies are always presented, at each of
          their unnumbered and innumerable performances, by new actors, and
          accordingly do not cease to find interested spectators: whereas we
          might well believe that the whole audience of the world-theatre had
          long since hanged themselves to every tree from sheer boredom at
          these performances. So much depends on new actors, so little on the
          piece.</p>

<p><span><span>What is</span>
<span><span>“</span><span>Being Obstinate</span><span>”</span></span><span>?</span></span>—The shortest way is not
          the straightest possible, but that wherein favourable winds swell our sails. So says the
          wisdom of seamen. Not to follow his course is obstinate, firmness
          of character being then adulterated by stupidity.</p>

<h2>
<span>60.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Word</span>
<span><span>“</span><span>Vanity.</span><span>”</span></span></span>—It is annoying
          that certain words, with which we moralists positively cannot
          dispense, involve in themselves a kind of censorship of morals,
          dating from the times when the most ordinary and natural impulses
          were denounced. Thus that fundamental conviction that on the waves
          of society we either find navigable waters or suffer shipwreck far
          more through what we appear than through what we are (a conviction
          that must act as guiding principle of all action in relation to
          society) is branded with the general word <span>“vanity.”</span> In other words, one of the most
          weighty and significant of qualities is branded with an expression
          which denotes it as essentially empty and negative: a great thing
          is designated by a diminutive, ay, even slandered by the strokes of
          caricature. There is no help for it; we must use such words, but
          then we must shut our ears to the insinuations of ancient
          habits.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>61.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Fatalism of
          the Turk.</span></span>—The fatalism of the Turk has this
          fundamental defect, that it contrasts man and fate as two distinct
          things. Man, says this doctrine, may struggle against fate and try
          to baffle it, but in the end fate will always gain the victory.
          Hence the most rational course is to resign oneself or to live as one pleases. As
          a matter of fact, every man is himself a piece of fate. When he
          thinks that he is struggling against fate in this way, fate is
          accomplishing its ends even in that struggle. The combat is a
          fantasy, but so is the resignation in fate—all these fantasies are
          included in fate.—The fear felt by most people of the doctrine that
          denies the freedom of the will is a fear of the fatalism of the
          Turk. They imagine that man will become weakly resigned and will
          stand before the future with folded hands, because he cannot alter
          anything of the future. Or that he will give a free rein to his
          caprices, because the predestined cannot be made worse by that
          course. The follies of men are as much a piece of fate as are his
          wise actions, and even that fear of belief in fate is a fatality.
          You yourself, you poor timid creature, are that indomitable
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span>Moira</span></span>, which rules even the
          Gods; whatever may happen, you are a curse or a blessing, and in
          any case the fetters wherein the strongest lies bound: in you the
          whole future of the human world is predestined, and it is no use

          morality from pity and all intellectuality from the isolation of
          the individual. Herein this philosophy is the unconscious pleader
          for all human deterioration. For pity needs suffering, and

          character-masks, too, as absolute, and in delineating them
          accordingly. Thus Molière is intelligible as the contemporary of

          and moral world, in accordance with such contrasts. An infinite
          amount of cruelty, arrogance, harshness, estrangement, and coldness

          fully know what he is doing? And if this point at least remains
          always debatable, men never have anything to forgive each other,
          and indulgence is for the reasonable man an impossible thing.
          Finally, if the evil-doers had really known what they did, we

          which we should be excluded, as from a holy place or holy of
          holies, which ought not to be trodden by our foot. Through the
          errors of others we have, nevertheless, penetrated to it, and we
          are now swayed partly by fear, partly by reverence, partly by
          surprise; we do not know whether we ought to fly or to enjoy the
          blissful moment with all its gracious advantages. In all shame
          there is a mystery, which seems desecrated or in danger of
          desecration through us. All <em><span>favour</span></em> begets shame.—But if it be
          remembered that we have never really <span>“deserved”</span> anything, this feeling of shame,
          provided that we surrender ourselves to this point of view in a
          spirit of Christian contemplation, becomes habitual, because upon
          such a one God seems continually to be conferring his blessing and
          his favours. Apart from this Christian interpretation, the state of
          habitual shame will be possible even to the entirely godless sage,
          who clings firmly to the basic non-responsibility and
          non-meritoriousness of all action and being. If he be treated as if
          he had deserved this or that, he will seem to have won his way into
          a higher order of beings, who do actually deserve something, who
          are free and can really bear the burden of responsibility for their
          own volition and capacity. Whoever says to him, <span>“You have deserved it,”</span> appears to cry
          out to him,
          <span>“You are not a human being, but a
          God.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Most

<p><span><span>Divine
          Missionaries.</span></span>—Even Socrates feels himself to be a
          divine missionary, but I am not sure whether we should not here
          detect a tincture of that Attic irony and fondness for jesting
          whereby this odious, arrogant conception would be toned down. He
          talks of the fact without unction—his images of the gadfly and the
          horse are simple and not sacerdotal. The real religious task which
          he has set himself—to <em><span>test</span></em> God in a hundred ways and see
          whether he spoke the truth—betrays a bold and free attitude, in
          which the missionary walked by the side of his God. This testing of
          God is one of the most subtle compromises between piety and
          free-thinking that has ever been devised.—Nowadays we do not even
          need this compromise any longer.</p>

<span>73.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Honesty in
          Painting.</span></span>—Raphael, who cared a great deal for the
          Church (so far as she could pay him), but, like the best men of his
          time, cared little for the objects of the Church's belief, did not
          advance one step to meet the exacting, ecstatic piety of many of
          his patrons. He remained honest even in that exceptional picture
          which was originally intended for a banner in a procession—the
          Sistine Madonna. Here for once he wished to paint a vision, but
          such a vision as even noble youths without <span>“faith”</span> may and will have—the vision of the
          future wife, a wise, high-souled, silent, and very beautiful woman,
          carrying her first-born in her arms. Let men of an older
          generation, accustomed to prayer and devotion, find here, like the worthy elder on the
          left, something superhuman to revere. We younger men (so Raphael
          seems to call to us) are occupied with the beautiful maiden on the
          right, who says to the spectator of the picture, with her
          challenging and by no means devout look, <span>“The mother and her child—is not that a pleasant,
          inviting sight?”</span> The face and the look are reflected in the
          joy in the faces of the beholders. The artist who devised all this
          enjoys himself in this way, and adds his own delight to the delight
          of the art-lover. As regards the <span>“messianic”</span> expression in the face of the child,
          Raphael, honest man, who would not paint any state of soul in which
          he did not believe, has amiably cheated his religious admirers. He
          painted that freak of nature which is very often found, the man's
          eye in the child's face, and that, too, the eye of a brave, helpful
          man who sees distress. This eye should be accompanied by a beard.
          The fact that a beard is wanting, and that two different ages are
          seen in one countenance, is the pleasing paradox which believers
          have interpreted in accordance with their faith in miracles. The
          artist could only expect as much from their art of exposition and
          interpretation.</p>

<h2>
<span>74.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Prayer.</span></span>—On two hypotheses
          alone is there any sense in prayer, that not quite extinct custom
          of olden times. It would have to be possible either to fix or alter
          the will of the godhead, and the devotee would have to know best
          himself what he needs and should really desire. Both hypotheses,
          axiomatic and
          traditional in all other religions, are denied by Christianity. If
          Christianity nevertheless maintained prayer side by side with its
          belief in the all-wise and all-provident divine reason (a belief
          that makes prayer really senseless and even blasphemous), it showed
          here once more its admirable <span>“wisdom of the
          serpent.”</span> For an outspoken command, <span>“Thou shalt not pray,”</span> would have led Christians
          by way of boredom to the denial of Christianity. In the Christian
          <span><span>ora et labora ora</span></span> plays the rôle
          of pleasure. Without <span><span>ora</span></span>
          what could those unlucky saints who renounced <span><span>labora</span></span> have done? But to have a
          chat with God, to ask him for all kinds of pleasant things, to feel
          a slight amusement at one's own folly in still having any wishes at
          all, in spite of so excellent a father—all that was an admirable
          invention for saints.</p>

          permanent. They are the body to which a new spirit is constantly
          being superadded. The cult, like an unchangeable text, is ever

          first brought the idea of sin into the world. The belief in the
          remedies, which is offered as an antidote, has gradually been

          general expression, both in speaking and writing, do not clearly
          betray the religious man, we need no longer take his views upon
          religion and his pleading for religion seriously. These opinions
          have become powerless for him if, judging by his style, he has at
          command irony, arrogance, malice, hatred, and all the changing
          eddies of mood, just like the most irreligious of men—how far more

<p><span><span>The Danger in
          Personality.</span></span>—The more God has been regarded as a

          far more attached to their thought-images than to their best
          beloved. That is why they sacrifice themselves for State, Church,
          and even for God—so far as he remains <em><span>their</span></em>
          creation, their thought, and is not too much looked upon as a
          personality. In the latter case they almost always quarrel with
          him. After all, it was the most pious of men who let slip that
          bitter cry: <span>“My God, why hast thou forsaken
          me?”</span></p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>81.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Worldly
          Justice.</span></span>—It is possible to unhinge worldly justice
          with the doctrine of the complete non-responsibility and innocence
          of every man. An attempt has been made in the same direction on the
          basis of the opposite doctrine of the full responsibility and guilt
          of every man. It was the founder of Christianity who wished to
          abolish worldly justice and banish judgment and punishment from the
          world. For he understood all guilt as <span>“sin”</span>—that is, an outrage against God and not
          against the world. On the other hand, he considered every man in a
          broad sense, and almost in every sense, a sinner. The guilty,
          however, are not to be the judges of their peers—so his rules
          of equity decided.
          Thus all dispensers of worldly justice were in his eyes as culpable
          as those they condemned, and their air of guiltlessness appeared to
          him hypocritical and pharisaical. Moreover, he looked to the
          motives and not to the results of actions, and thought that only
          one was keen-sighted enough to give a verdict on motives—himself
          or, as he expressed it, God.</p>

<p><span><span>An Affectation
          in Parting.</span></span>—He who wishes to sever his connection
          with a party or a creed thinks it necessary for him to refute it.
          This is a most arrogant notion. The only thing necessary is that he
          should clearly see what tentacles hitherto held him to this party
          or creed and no longer hold him, what views impelled him to it and
          now impel him in some other directions. We have not joined the
          party or creed on strict grounds of knowledge. We should not affect
          this attitude on parting from it either.</p>

<h2>
<span>83.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Saviour and
          Physician.</span></span>—In his knowledge of the human soul the
          founder of Christianity was, as is natural, not without many great
          deficiencies and prejudices, and, as physician of the soul, was
          addicted to that disreputable, laical belief in a universal
          medicine. In his methods he sometimes resembles that dentist who
          wishes to heal all pain by extracting the tooth. Thus, for example,
          he assails sensuality with the advice: <span>“If
          thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.”</span>—Yet there still
          remains the distinction that the dentist at least attains his object—painlessness for the
          patient—although in so clumsy a fashion that he becomes ridiculous;
          whereas the Christian who follows that advice and thinks he has
          killed his sensuality, is wrong, for his sensuality still lives in
          an uncanny, vampire form, and torments him in hideous
          disguises.</p>

<p><span><span>Prisoners.</span></span>—One morning the
          prisoners entered the yard for work, but the warder was not there.
          Some, as their manner was, set to work at once; others stood idle
          and gazed defiantly around. Then one of them strode forward and
          cried, <span>“Work as much as you will or do
          nothing, it all comes to the same. Your secret machinations have
          come to light; the warder has been keeping his eye on you of late,
          and will cause a terrible judgment to be passed upon you in a few
          days' time. You know him—he is of a cruel and resentful
          disposition. But now, listen: you have mistaken me hitherto. I am
          not what I seem, but far more—I am the son of the warder, and can
          get anything I like out of him. I can save you—nay, I will save
          you. But remember this: I will only save those of you who
          <em><span>believe</span></em> that I am the son of the
          prison warder. The rest may reap the fruits of their
          unbelief.”</span> <span>“Well,”</span> said an
          old prisoner after an interval of silence, <span>“what can it matter to you whether we believe you or
          not? If you are really the son, and can do what you say, then put
          in a good word for us all. That would be a real kindness on your
          part. But have done with all talk of belief and unbelief!”</span> <span>“What is more,”</span> cried a younger man,
          <span>“I don't believe him: he has only got a bee
          in his bonnet. I'll wager that in a week's time we shall find
          ourselves in the same place as we are to-day, and the warder will
          know nothing.”</span> <span>“And if the warder
          ever knew anything, he knows it no longer,”</span> said the last of
          the prisoners, coming down into the yard at that moment,
          <span>“for he has just died suddenly.”</span>
<span>“Ah ha!”</span> cried several in confusion,
          <span>“ah ha! Sir Son, Sir Son, how stands it now
          with your title? Are we by any chance <em><span>your</span></em>
          prisoners now?”</span> <span>“I told you,”</span>
          answered the man gently, <span>“I will set free
          all who believe in me, as surely as my father still
          lives.”</span>—The prisoners did not laugh, but shrugged their
          shoulders and left him to himself.</p>

          from time immemorial, and that this fair world was made in order
          that the glory of God might be manifested therein. So heaven and
          hell and mankind merely exist to satisfy the vanity of God! What a
          cruel, insatiable vanity must have smouldered in the soul of the
          first or second thinker of such a thought!—Paul, then, after all,
          remained Saul—the persecutor of God.</p>

<p><span><span>Socrates.</span></span>—If all goes

          the path of moral reason, men will rather take up the <span><span>Memorabilia</span></span> of Socrates than the
          Bible, and when Montaigne and Horace will be used as pioneers and
          guides for the understanding of Socrates, the simplest and most
          enduring of interpretative sages. In him converge the roads of the
          most different philosophic modes of life, which are in truth the
          modes of the different temperaments, crystallised by reason and
          habit and all ultimately directed towards the delight in life and
          in self. The apparent conclusion is that the most peculiar thing
          about Socrates was his share in all the temperaments. Socrates
          excels the founder of Christianity by virtue of his merry style of
          seriousness and by that wisdom of sheer roguish pranks which
          constitutes the best state of soul in a man. Moreover, he had a

<p><span><span>Learning to

          the age of city-state culture is over. The limit allowed by
          Aristotle to the great city—in which the town-crier must be able to
          make himself heard by the whole assembled community—troubles us as
          little as do any city-communities, us who even wish to be
          understood beyond the boundaries of nations. Therefore every one
          who is of a good European turn of mind must learn to <em><span>write</span></em>
          well, and to write better and better. He cannot help himself, he
          must learn that: even if he was born in Germany, where bad writing
          is looked upon as a national privilege. Better writing means better
          thinking; always to discover matter more worthy of communication; to be able to
          communicate it properly; to be translateable into the tongues of
          neighbouring nations; to make oneself comprehensible to foreigners
          who learn our language; to work with the view of making all that is
          good common property, and of giving free access everywhere to the
          free; finally, to pave the way for that still remote state of
          things, when the great task shall come for good Europeans—guidance
          and guardianship of the universal world-culture.—Whoever preaches
          the opposite doctrine of not troubling about good writing and good
          reading (both virtues grow together and decline together) is really
          showing the peoples a way of becoming more and more <em><span>national</span></em>. He is intensifying the
          malady of this century, and is a foe to good Europeans, a foe to
          free spirits.</p>

          another, it may be the theory of finding expressions for the more
          desirable human moods, the communication and transference of which
          one desires most—for the mood of a man moved from the depth of his
          heart, intellectually cheerful, bright, and sincere, who has

          German.</span></span>—German prose, which is really not fashioned
          on any pattern and must be considered an original creation of
          German taste, should give the eager advocate of a future original
          German culture an indication of how real German dress, German
          society, German furniture, German meals would look without the
          imitation of models.—Some one who had long reflected on these
          vistas finally cried in great horror, <span>“But,
          Heaven help us, perhaps we already have that original culture—only
          we don't like to talk about it!”</span></p>

          vice of logical paradox. They apply <em><span>logical</span></em>

          built in the air. (<span>“Therefore”</span> with

<p><span><span>Displaying

          vice which clever Frenchmen have of adding a touch of <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span>dédain</span></span> to their best ideas
          arises from a desire to be considered richer than they really are.

<p><span><span>French and
          German Literature.</span></span>—The misfortune of the French and
          German literature of the last hundred years is that the Germans ran
          away too early from the French school, and the French, later on,
          went too early to the German school.</p>

<p><span><span>Our
          Prose.</span></span>—None of the present-day cultured nations has
          so bad a prose as the German. When clever, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span>blasé</span></span> Frenchmen say,
          <span>“There is no German prose,”</span> we ought
          really not to be angry, for this criticism is more polite than we
          deserve. If we look for reasons, we come at last to the strange
          phenomenon that the German knows only improvised prose and has no
          conception of any other. He simply cannot understand the Italian,
          who says that prose is as much harder than poetry as the
          representation of naked beauty is harder to the sculptor than that
          of draped beauty. Verse, images, rhythm, and rhyme need honest
          effort—that even the German realises, and he is not inclined to set
          a very high value on extempore poetry. But the notion of working at
          a page of prose as at a statue sounds to him like a tale from
          fairyland.</p>

<p><span><span>Dodging.</span></span>—We do not

          say what word every mediocre writer would inevitably have hit upon
          in expressing the same idea. All great artists, in steering their
          car, show themselves prone to dodge and leave the track, but never
          to fall over.</p>

          art there must be something like bread, in order that they may
          produce divers effects. If these effects followed one another
          without occasional pauses and intervals, they would soon make us
          weary and provoke disgust—in fact, a long meal of art would then be

          found almost everything enjoyable, but had no taste; possessed
          feeling and seriousness, but in dispensing them poured over them a
          nauseous sauce of tears; had even wit, but, unfortunately for his
          ardent desire for it, far too little—whence he drives the reader to
          despair by his very lack of wit. In short, he was the bright,
          rank-smelling weed that shot up overnight in the fair pleasaunces
          of Schiller and Goethe. He was a good, comfortable man, and yet a

          point of view and imposes upon them its laws and customs. At table
          one can receive disclosures about the most subtle secrets of the
          arts; it suffices to observe what tastes good and when and after
          what and how long it tastes good.</p>

<p><span><span>Lessing.</span></span>—Lessing had a

          French school. He knows well how to arrange and display his wares
          in his shop-window. Without this true art his thoughts, like the
          objects of them, would have remained rather in the dark, nor would
          the general loss be great. His art, however, has taught many
          (especially the last generation of German scholars) and has given
          enjoyment to a countless number. It is true his disciples had no
          need to learn from him, as they often did, his unpleasant tone with
          its mingling of petulance and candour.—Opinion is now unanimous on
          Lessing as <span>“lyric poet,”</span> and will

          thought looks out freely through the veil.—Poets' thoughts are as a

<p><span><span>Write Simply

<p><span><span>Wieland.</span></span>—Wieland wrote
          German better than any one else, and had the genuine adequacies and
          inadequacies of the master. His translations of the letters of
          Cicero and Lucian are the best in the language. His ideas, however,
          add nothing to our store of thought. We can endure his cheerful
          moralities as little as his cheerful immoralities, for both are
          very closely connected. The men who enjoyed them were at bottom
          better men than we are, but also a good deal heavier. They
          <em><span>needed</span></em> an author of this sort. The
          Germans did not need Goethe, and therefore cannot make proper use
          of him. We have only to consider the best of our statesmen and artists in this
          light. None of them had or <em><span>could</span></em> have had Goethe as their
          teacher.</p>

<p><span><span>The Treasure of
          German Prose.</span></span>—Apart from Goethe's writings and
          especially Goethe's conversations with Eckermann (the best German
          book in existence), what German prose literature remains that is
          worth reading over and over again? Lichtenberg's <span><span>Aphorisms</span></span>, the first book of
          Jung-Stilling's <span><span>Story of My Life</span></span>, Adalbert
          Stifter's <span><span>St. Martin's Summer</span></span> and
          Gottfried Keller's <span><span>People of Seldwyla</span></span>—and there,

<div>
<h2>
<span>110.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Literary and
          Colloquial Style.</span></span>—The art of writing demands, first
          and foremost, substitutions for the means of expression which
          speech alone possesses—in other words, for gestures, accent,
          intonation, and look. Hence literary style is quite different from
          colloquial style, and far more difficult, because it has to make
          itself as intelligible as the latter with fewer accessaries.
          Demosthenes delivered his speeches differently from what we read;
          he worked them up for reading purposes.—Cicero's speeches ought to be <span>“demosthenised”</span> with the same object, for at
          present they contain more of the Roman Forum than we can

<p><span><span>Caution in

          expression or idea only looks well among its peers; that an
          excellent quotation may spoil whole pages, nay the whole book; for
          it seems to cry warningly to the reader, <span>“Mark you, I am the precious stone, and round about me
          is lead—pale, worthless lead!”</span> Every word, every idea only
          desires to live in its own company—that is the moral of a choice
          style.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>112.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>How should
          Errors be Enunciated?</span></span>—We may dispute whether it be
          more injurious for errors to be enunciated badly or as well as the
          best truths. It is certain that in the former case they are doubly
          harmful to the brain and are less easily removed from it. But, on
          the other hand, they are not so certain of effect as in the latter
          case. They are, in fact, less contagious.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>113.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Limiting and
          Widening.</span></span>—Homer limited and diminished the horizon of
          his subject, but allowed individual scenes to expand and blossom
          out. Later, the tragedians are constantly renewing this process.
          Each takes his material in ever smaller and smaller fragments than
          his predecessor did, but each attains a greater wealth of blooms within the narrow hedges of

<p><span><span>Literature and

          literature by what forces the Greek spirit developed, how it
          entered upon different channels, and where it became enfeebled. All
          this also depicts to us how Greek morality proceeded, and how all
          morality will proceed: how it was at first a constraint and
          displayed cruelty, then became gradually milder; how a pleasure in
          certain actions, in certain forms and conventions arose, and from
          this again a propensity for solitary exercise, for solitary
          possession; how the track becomes crowded and overcrowded with
          competitors; how satiety enters in, new objects of struggle and
          ambition are sought, and forgotten aims are awakened to life; how
          the drama is repeated, and the spectators become altogether weary
          of looking on, because the whole gamut seems to have been run
          through—and then comes a stoppage, an expiration, and the rivulets
          are lost in the sand. The end, or at any rate <em><span>an</span></em> end,

          formula for it; it remains beyond my grasp as a whole. I notice
          that all landscapes which please me permanently have a simple
          geometrical scheme of lines underneath all their complexity. Without such a
          mathematical substratum no scenery becomes artistically pleasing.

          tints, but we must determine the degree of pallor in close relation
          to the richly and deeply coloured background, that always hovers
          before our eyes and acts as our guide—in other words, in accordance
          with the way in which we should <em><span>declaim</span></em>
          the same passages. That is why we must be able to declaim.</p>

<p><span><span>Herder.</span></span>—Herder fails to be
          all that he made people think he was and himself wished to think he
          was. He was no great thinker or discoverer, no newly fertile soil
          with the unexhausted strength of a virgin forest. But he possessed
          in the highest degree the power of scenting the future, he saw and
          picked the first-fruits of the seasons earlier than all others, and
          they then believed that he had made them grow. Between darkness and
          light, youth and age, his mind was like a hunter on the watch, looking everywhere for
          transitions, depressions, convulsions, the outward and visible
          signs of internal growth. The unrest of spring drove him to and
          fro, but he was himself not the spring.—At times, indeed, he had
          some inkling of this, and yet would fain not have believed it—he,
          the ambitious priest, who would have so gladly been the
          intellectual pope of his epoch! This is his despair. He seems to
          have lived long as a pretender to several kingdoms or even to a
          universal monarchy. He had his following which believed in him,
          among others the young Goethe. But whenever crowns were really
          distributed, he was passed over. Kant, Goethe, and then the first
          true German historians and scholars robbed him of what he thought
          he had reserved for himself (although in silence and secret he
          often thought the reverse). Just when he doubted in himself, he
          gladly clothed himself in dignity and enthusiasm: these were often
          in him mere garments, which had to hide a great deal and also to
          deceive and comfort him. He really had fire and enthusiasm, but his
          ambition was far greater! It blew impatiently at the fire, which
          flickered, crackled, and smoked—his <em><span>style</span></em>
          flickers, crackles, and smokes—but he yearned for the great flame
          which never broke out. He did not sit at the table of the genuine
          creators, and his ambition did not admit of his sitting modestly
          among those who simply enjoy. Thus he was a restless spirit, the
          taster of all intellectual dishes, which were collected by the
          Germans from every quarter and every age in the course of half a
          century. Never really happy and satisfied, Herder was also
          too often ill, and
          then at times envy sat by his bed, and hypocrisy paid her visit as
          well. He always had an air of being scarred and crippled, and he
          lacked simple, stalwart manliness more completely than any of the
          so-called <span>“classical writers.”</span></p>

<span>122.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Artistic
          Convention.</span></span>—Three-fourths of Homer is convention, and
          the same is the case with all the Greek artists, who had no reason
          for falling into the modern craze for originality. They had no fear
          of convention, for after all convention was a link between them and
          their public. Conventions are the artistic means <em><span>acquired</span></em> for the understanding of
          the hearer; the common speech, learnt with much toil, whereby the
          artist can really communicate his ideas. All the more when he
          wishes, like the Greek poets and musicians, to conquer at once with each of his
          works (since he is accustomed to compete publicly with one or two
          rivals), the first condition is that he must be understood at once,
          and this is only possible by means of convention. What the artist
          devises beyond convention he offers of his own free will and takes
          a risk, his success at best resulting in the setting-up of a new
          convention. As a rule originality is marvelled at, sometimes even
          worshipped, but seldom understood. A stubborn avoidance of
          convention means a desire not to be understood. What, then, is the
          object of the modern craze for originality?</p>

<h2>
<span>123.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Artists'
          Affectation of Scientific Method.</span></span>—Schiller, like
          other German artists, fancied that if a man had intellect he was
          entitled to improvise even with the pen on all difficult subjects.
          So there we see his prose essays—in every way a model of how
          <em><span>not</span></em> to attack scientific questions
          of æsthetics and ethics, and a danger for young readers who, in
          their admiration for Schiller the poet, have not the courage to
          think meanly of Schiller the thinker and author.—The temptation to
          traverse for once the forbidden paths, and to have his say in
          science as well, is easy and pardonable in the artist. For even the
          ablest artist from time to time finds his handicraft and his
          workshop unendurable. This temptation is so strong that it makes
          the artist show all the world what no one wishes to see, that his
          little chamber of thought is cramped and untidy. Why not, indeed? He does not live there. He
          proceeds to show that the storeroom of his knowledge is partly
          empty, partly filled with lumber. Why not, indeed? This condition
          does not really become the artist-child badly. In particular, the
          artist shows that for the very easiest exercises of scientific
          method, which are accessible even to beginners, his joints are too
          stiff and untrained. Even of that he need not really be ashamed! On
          the other hand, he often develops no mean art in imitating all the
          mistakes, vices, and base pedantries that are practised in the
          scientific community, in the belief that these belong to the
          appearance of the thing, if not to the thing itself. This is the
          very point that is so amusing in artists' writing, that the artist
          involuntarily acts as his vocation demands: he parodies the
          scientific and inartistic natures. Towards science he should show
          no attitude but that of parody, in so far as he is an artist and
          only an artist.</p>

          plunged into despair: a great scholar of all the four Faculties is
          the evil-doer. That cannot have happened in the ordinary course,
          surely? No, certainly not! Without the aid of the devil incarnate,
          the great scholar would never have achieved the deed.—Is this
          really destined to be the greatest German <span>“tragic idea,”</span> as one hears it said among
          Germans?—But for Goethe even this idea was too terrible. His kind
          heart could not avoid placing the little sempstress, <span>“the good soul that forgot <span>itself but once,”</span> near to the saints,
          after her involuntary death. Even the great scholar, <span>“the good man”</span> with <span>“the
          dark impulse,”</span> is brought into heaven in the nick of time,
          by a trick which is played upon the devil at the decisive moment.
          In heaven the lovers find themselves again. Goethe once said that
          his nature was too conciliatory for really tragic subjects.</p>

<p><span><span>Are
          there</span> <span><span>“</span><span>German Classics</span><span>”</span></span><span>?</span></span>—Sainte-Beuve observes
          somewhere that the word <span>“classic”</span>
          does not suit the genius of certain literatures. For instance,
          nobody could talk seriously of <span>“German
          classics.”</span>—What do our German publishers, who are about to
          add fifty more to the fifty German classics we are told to accept,
          say to that? Does it not almost seem as if one need only have been
          dead for the last thirty years, and lie a lawful prey to the
          public, in
          order to hear suddenly and unexpectedly the trumpet of resurrection
          as a <span>“Classic”</span>? And this in an age
          and a nation where at least five out of the six great fathers of
          its literature are undoubtedly antiquated or becoming
          antiquated—without there being any need for the age or the nation
          to be ashamed of this. For those writers have given way before the
          strength of our time—let that be considered in all
          fairness!—Goethe, as I have indicated, I do not include. He belongs
          to a higher species than <span>“national
          literatures”</span>: hence life, revival, and decay do not enter into the reckoning in
          his relations with his countrymen. He lived and now lives but for
          the few; for the majority he is nothing but a flourish of vanity
          which is trumpeted from time to time across the border into foreign
          ears. Goethe, not merely a great and good man, but a <em><span>culture</span></em>, is in German history an
          interlude without a sequel. Who, for instance, would be able to
          point to any trace of Goethe's influence in German politics of the
          last seventy years (whereas the influence, certainly of Schiller,
          and perhaps of Lessing, can be traced in the political world)? But
          what of those five others? Klopstock, in a most honourable way,
          became out of date even in his own lifetime, and so completely that
          the meditative book of his later years, <span><span>The Republic of
          Learning</span></span>, has never been taken seriously from that
          day to this. Herder's misfortune was that his writings were always
          either new or antiquated. Thus for stronger and more subtle minds
          (like Lichtenberg) even Herder's masterpiece, his <span><span>Ideas for the History
          of Mankind</span></span>, was in a way antiquated at the very
          moment of its appearance. Wieland, who lived to the full and made
          others live likewise, was clever enough to anticipate by death the
          waning of his influence. Lessing, perhaps, still lives to-day—but
          among a young and ever younger band of scholars. Schiller has
          fallen from the hands of young men into those of boys, of all
          German boys. It is a well-known sign of obsolescence when a book
          descends to people of less and less mature age.—Well, what is it
          that has thrust these five into the background, so that
          well-educated men of affairs no longer read them? A better taste, a riper
          knowledge, a higher reverence for the real and the true: in other
          words, the very virtues which these five (and ten or twenty others
          of lesser repute) first re-planted in Germany, and which now, like
          a mighty forest, cast over their graves not only the shadow of awe,
          but something of the shadow of oblivion.—But classical writers are
          not planters of intellectual and literary virtues. They bring those
          virtues to perfection and are their highest luminous peaks, and
          being brighter, freer, and purer than all that surrounds them, they
          remain shining above the nations when the nations themselves
          perish. There may come an elevated stage of humanity, in which the
          Europe of the peoples is a dark, forgotten thing, but Europe lives
          on in thirty books, very old but never antiquated—in the
          classics.</p>

          either of an immature or of a corrupted taste. A noble poverty but a
          masterly freedom within the limits of that modest wealth
          distinguishes the Greek artists in oratory. They wish to have less
          than the people has—for the people is richest in old and new—but
          they wish to have that little <em><span>better</span></em>. The reckoning up of their
          archaic and exotic forms is soon done, but we never cease
          marvelling if we have an eye for their light and delicate manner in

<p><span><span>Bad

<p><span><span>Presence of

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>135.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Choice
          Ideas.</span></span>—The choice style of a momentous period does
          not only select its words but its ideas—and both from the customary
          and prevailing usage. Venturesome ideas, that smell too fresh, are
          to the maturer taste no less repugnant than new and reckless images
          and phrases. Later on both choice ideas and choice words soon smack
          of mediocrity, because the scent of the choice vanishes quickly,
          and then nothing but the customary and commonplace element is
          tasted.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>136.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Main Reason for
          Corruption of Style.</span></span>—The desire to display more
          sentiment than one really feels for a thing corrupts style, in
          language and in all art. All great art shows rather the opposite
          tendency. Like every man of moral significance, it loves to check
          emotion on its way and not let it run its course to the very end.
          This modesty of letting emotion but half appear is most clearly to
          be observed, for example, in Sophocles. The features of sentiment
          seem to become beautified when sentiment feigns to be more shy than
          it really is.</p>

<p><span><span>An Excuse for
          the Heavy Style.</span></span>—The lightly uttered phrase seldom
          falls on the ear with the full weight of the subject. This is,
          however, due to the bad training of the ear, which by education
          must pass from what has hitherto been called music to the school of
          the higher harmony—in other words, to conversation.</p>

<p><span><span>Bird's-Eye
          Views.</span></span>—Here torrents rush from every side into a
          ravine: their movement is so swift and stormy, and carries the eye
          along so quickly, that the bare or wooded mountain slopes around
          seem not to sink down but to fly down. We are in an agonised
          tension at the sight, as if behind all this were hidden some
          hostile element, before which all must fly, and against which the
          abyss alone gave protection. This landscape cannot be painted,
          unless we hover above it like a bird in the open air. Here for once the
          so-called bird's-eye view is not an artistic caprice, but the sole
          possibility.</p>

<h2>
<span>139.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Rash
          Comparisons.</span></span>—If rash comparisons are not proofs of
          the wantonness of the writer, they are proofs of the exhaustion of
          his imagination. In any case they bear witness to his bad
          taste.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>140.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Dancing in
          Chains.</span></span>—In the case of every Greek artist, poet, or
          writer we must ask: What is the new constraint which he imposes
          upon himself and makes attractive to his contemporaries, so as to
          find imitators? For the thing called <span>“invention”</span> (in metre, for example) is always a
          self-imposed fetter of this kind. <span>“Dancing
          in chains”</span>—to make that hard for themselves and then to
          spread a false notion that it is easy—that is the trick that they
          wish to show us. Even in Homer we may perceive a wealth of
          inherited formulæ and laws of epic narration, within the circle of
          which he had to dance, and he himself created new conventions for
          them that came after. This was the discipline of the Greek poets:
          first to impose upon themselves a manifold constraint by means of
          the earlier poets; then to invent in addition a new constraint, to
          impose it upon themselves and cheerfully to overcome it, so that
          constraint and victory are perceived and admired.</p>

<p><span><span>Authors'
          Copiousness.</span></span>—The last quality that a good author

          are permitted to rest from their victories.</p>

<p><span><span>Wheezing
          Heroes.</span></span>—Poets and artists who suffer from a narrow

          not know what easy breathing means.</p>

<h2>
<span>143.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The
          Short-Sighted.</span></span>—The
          short-sighted are the deadly foes of all authors who let themselves
          go. These authors should know the wrath with which these people
          shut the book in which they observe that its creator needs fifty
          pages to express five ideas. And the cause of their wrath is that
          they have endangered what remains of their vision almost without
          compensation. A short-sighted person said, <span>“All authors let themselves go.”</span> <span>“Even the Holy Ghost?”</span> <span>“Even the Holy Ghost.”</span> But he had a right to,
          for he wrote for those who had lost their sight altogether.</p>

<h2>
<span>144.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Style of
          Immortality.</span></span>—Thucydides and Tacitus both imagined
          immortal life for their works when they executed them. That might
          be guessed (if not known otherwise) from their style. The one thought to give
          permanence to his ideas by salting them, the other by boiling them
          down; and neither, it seems, made a miscalculation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>145.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Against Images
          and Similes.</span></span>—By images and similes we convince, but
          we do not prove. That is why science has such a horror of images
          and similes. Science does not want to convince or make plausible,
          and rather seeks to provoke cold distrust by its mode of
          expression, by the bareness of its walls. For distrust is the
          touchstone for the gold of certainty.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>146.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Caution.</span></span>—In Germany, he
          who lacks thorough knowledge should beware of writing. The good
          German does not say in that case <span>“he is
          ignorant,”</span> but <span>“he is of doubtful
          character.”</span>—This hasty conclusion, by the way, does great
          credit to the Germans.</p>

<p><span><span>The Grand Style

          reasons for this are inextricably bound up with morality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>149.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Sebastian
          Bach.</span></span>—In so far as we do not hear Bach's music as
          perfect and experienced connoisseurs of counterpoint and all the
          varieties of the fugal style (and accordingly must dispense with
          real artistic enjoyment), we shall feel in listening to his
          music—in Goethe's magnificent phrase—as if <span>“we were present at God's creation of the
          world.”</span> In other words, we feel here that something great is
          in the making but not yet made—our mighty modern music, which by
          conquering nationalities, the Church, and counterpoint has
          conquered the world. In Bach there is still too much crude
          Christianity, crude Germanism, crude scholasticism. He stands on
          the threshold of modern European music, but turns from thence to
          look at the Middle Ages.</p>

<h2>
<span>150.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Händel.</span></span>—Händel, who in the
          invention of his music was bold, original, truthful, powerful,
          inclined to and akin to all the heroism of which a <em><span>nation</span></em>
          is capable, often proved stiff, cold, nay even weary of himself in
          composition. He applied a few well-tried methods of execution,
          wrote copiously and quickly, and was glad when he had finished—but
          that joy was not the joy of God and other creators in the eventide
          of their working day.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>151.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Haydn.</span></span>—So far as genius
          can exist in a man who is merely <em><span>good</span></em>,
          Haydn had genius. He went just as far as the limit which morality sets to intellect, and only
          wrote music that has <span>“no past.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>152.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Beethoven and
          Mozart.</span></span>—Beethoven's music often appears like a deeply
          emotional meditation on unexpectedly hearing once more a piece long
          thought to be forgotten, <span>“Tonal
          Innocence”</span>: it is music about music. In the song of the
          beggar and child in the street, in the monotonous airs of vagrant
          Italians, in the dance of the village inn or in carnival nights he
          discovers his melodies. He stores them together like a bee,
          snatching here and there some notes or a short phrase. To him these
          are hallowed memories of <span>“the better
          world,”</span> like the ideas of Plato.—Mozart stands in quite a
          different relation to his melodies. He finds his inspiration not in
          hearing music but in gazing at life, at the most stirring life of
          southern lands. He was always dreaming of Italy, when he was not
          there.</p>

<p><span><span>Recitative.</span></span>—Formerly
          recitative was dry, but now we live in the age of moist recitative.

<p><span><span><span>“</span><span>Cheerful</span><span>”</span></span> <span>Music.</span></span>—If for a long time
          we have heard no music, it then goes like a heavy southern wine all
          too quickly into the blood and leaves behind it a soul dazed with
          narcotics, half-awake, longing for sleep. This is particularly the case with cheerful
          music, which inspires in us bitterness and pain, satiety and
          home-sickness together, and forces us to sip again and again as at
          a sweetened draught of poison. The hall of gay, noisy merriment
          then seems to grow narrow, the light to lose its brightness and
          become browner. At last we feel as if this music were penetrating
          to a prison where a poor wretch cannot sleep for home-sickness.</p>

<span>155.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Franz
          Schubert</span></span>.—Franz Schubert, inferior as an artist to
          the other great musicians, had nevertheless the largest share of
          inherited musical wealth. He spent it with a free hand and a kind
          heart, so that for a few centuries musicians will continue to
          <em><span>nibble</span></em> at his ideas and
          inspirations. In his works we find a store of <em><span>unused</span></em>
          inventions; the greatness of others will lie in making use of those
          inventions. If Beethoven may be called the ideal listener for a
          troubadour, Schubert has a right to be called the ideal
          troubadour.</p>

<span>156.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Modern Musical
          Execution</span></span>.—Great tragic or dramatic execution of
          music acquires its character by imitating the gesture of the great
          sinner, such as Christianity conceives and desires him: the
          slow-stepping, passionately brooding man, distracted by the agonies
          of conscience, now flying in terror, now clutching with delight,
          now standing still in despair—and all the other marks of great
          sinfulness. Only on the Christian assumption that all men are great sinners and
          do nothing but sin could we justify the application of this style
          of execution to <em><span>all</span></em> music. So far, music would be
          the reflection of all the actions and impulses of man, and would
          continually have to express by gestures the language of the great
          sinner. At such a performance, a listener who was not enough of a
          Christian to understand this logic might indeed cry out in horror,
          <span>“For the love of Heaven, how did sin find
          its way into music?”</span></p>

          <span>“in front,”</span> much of a future?—But
          did he want it to have a future? He possessed a virtue rare among
          artists, that of gratitude without <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span>arrière-pensée</span></span>. This virtue,

<p><span><span>A Mother of
          Arts.</span></span>—In our sceptical age, real devotion requires
          almost a brutal heroism of ambition. Fanatical shutting of the eyes
          and bending of the knee no longer suffice. Would it not be possible
          for ambition—in its eagerness to be the last devotee of all the
          ages—to become the begetter of a final church music, as it has been
          the begetter of the final church architecture? (They call it the
          Jesuit style.)</p>

<p><span><span>Freedom in
          Fetters—a Princely Freedom.</span></span>—Chopin, the last of the
          modern musicians, who gazed at and worshipped beauty, like
          Leopardi; Chopin, the Pole, the inimitable (none that came before
          or after him has a right to this name)—Chopin had the same princely
          punctilio in convention that Raphael shows in the use of the
          simplest traditional colours. The only difference is that Chopin
          applies them not to colour but to melodic and rhythmic traditions.
          He admitted the validity of these traditions because he was born
          under the sway of etiquette. But in these fetters he plays and
          dances as the freest and daintiest of spirits, and, be it observed,
          he does not spurn the chain.</p>

<p><span><span>Chopin's
          Barcarolle.</span></span>—Almost all states and modes of life have
          a moment of rapture, and good artists know how to discover that
          moment. Such a moment there is even in life by the seashore—that
          dreary, sordid, unhealthy existence, dragged out in the
          neighbourhood of a noisy and covetous rabble. This moment of
          rapture Chopin in his Barcarolle expressed in sound so supremely
          that Gods themselves, when they heard it, might yearn to lie long
          summer evenings in a boat.</p>

          Stripling,”</span> as the romantic songsters of Germany and France
          of the first three decades of this century imagined him—this stripling was
          completely translated into song and melody by Robert Schumann, the
          eternal youth, so long as he felt himself in full possession of his
          powers. There are indeed moments when his music reminds one of the
          eternal <span>“old maid.”</span></p>

<p><span><span>Dramatic
          Music.</span></span>—For him who does not see what is happening on
          the stage, dramatic music is a monstrosity, just as the running
          commentary to a lost text is a monstrosity. Such music requires us
          to have ears where our eyes are. This, however, is doing violence
          to Euterpe, who, poor Muse, wants to have her eyes and ears where
          the other Muses have theirs.</p>

<p><span><span>Victory and

          which artists provoke by their works and apologias for their works,
          just as is the case in real war, it is might and not reason that
          decides. All the world now assumes as a historical fact that, in
          his dispute with Piccini, Gluck was in the right. At any rate, he
          was victorious, and had might on his side.</p>

<h2>
<span>165.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Of the
          Principle of Musical Execution.</span></span>—Do the modern musical
          performers really believe that the supreme law of their art is to
          give every piece as much high-relief as is possible, and to make it
          speak at all costs a dramatic language? Is not this principle, when
          applied for example to Mozart, a veritable sin against the
          spirit—the gay, sunny, airy, delicate spirit—of Mozart, whose
          seriousness was of a kindly and not awe-inspiring order, whose
          pictures do not try to leap from the wall and drive away the
          beholder in panic? Or do you think that all Mozart's music is
          identical with the statue-music in <span><span>Don
          Juan</span></span>? And not only Mozart's, but all music?—You reply
          that the advantage of your principle lies in its greater <em><span>effect</span></em>.
          You would be right if there did not remain the counter-question,
          <span>“<em><span>On whom</span></em> has the effect operated,
          and <em><span>on
          whom</span></em> should an artist of the first rank desire to
          produce his effect?”</span> Never on the populace! Never on the
          immature! Never on the morbidly sensitive! Never on the diseased!
          And above all—never on the <span>blasé</span>!</p>

<p><span><span>The Music of
          To-Day.</span></span>—This ultra-modern music, with its strong

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>167.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Where Music is
          at Home.</span></span>—Music reaches its high-water mark only among
          men who have not the ability or the right to argue. Accordingly, its chief promoters are
          princes, whose aim is that there should be not much criticism nor
          even much thought in their neighbourhood. Next come societies
          which, under some pressure or other (political or religious), are
          forced to become habituated to silence, and so feel all the greater
          need of spells to charm away emotional ennui—these spells being
          generally eternal love-making and eternal music. Thirdly, we must
          reckon whole nations in which there is no <span>“society,”</span> but all the greater number of
          individuals with a bent towards solitude, mystical thinking, and a
          reverence for all that is inexpressible; these are the genuine
          <span>“musical souls.”</span> The Greeks, as a
          nation delighting in talking and argument, accordingly put up with
          music only as an <span>hors d'œuvre</span> to
          those arts which really admit of discussion and dispute. About
          music one can hardly even <em><span>think</span></em> clearly. The Pythagoreans,
          who in so many respects were exceptional Greeks, are said to have
          been great musicians. This was the school that invented a
          five-years' silence, but
          did not invent a dialectic.</p>

<p><span><span>Sentimentality
          in Music.</span></span>—We may be ever so much in sympathy with
          serious and profound music, yet nevertheless, or perhaps all the
          more for that reason, we shall at occasional moments be
          overpowered, entranced, and almost melted away by its opposite—I mean, by those simple
          Italian operatic airs which, in spite of all their monotony of
          rhythm and childishness of harmony, seem at times to sing to us
          like the very soul of music. Admit this or not as you please, you
          Pharisees of good taste, it is so, and it is my present task to
          propound the riddle that it is so, and to nibble a little myself at
          the solution.—In childhood's days we tasted the honey of many
          things for the first time. Never was honey so good as then; it
          seduced us to life, into abundant life, in the guise of the first
          spring, the first flower, the first butterfly, the first
          friendship. Then—perhaps in our ninth year or so—we heard our first
          music, and this was the first that we understood; thus the simplest
          and most childish tunes, that were not much more than a sequel to
          the nurse's lullaby and the strolling fiddler's tune, were our
          first experience. (For even the most trifling <span>“revelations”</span> of art need preparation and study;
          there is no <span>“immediate”</span> effect of
          art, whatever charming fables the philosophers may tell.) Our
          sensation on hearing these Italian airs is associated with those
          first musical raptures, the strongest of our lives. The bliss of
          childhood and its flight, the feeling that our most precious
          possession can never be brought back, all this moves the chords of
          the soul more strongly than the most serious and profound music can
          move them.—This mingling of æsthetic pleasure with moral pain,
          which nowadays it is customary to call (rather too haughtily, I
          think) <span>“sentimentality”</span>—it is the
          mood of Faust at the end of the first scene—this <span>“sentimentality”</span> of the listener is all to the
          advantage of Italian music. It is a feeling which the experienced
          connoisseurs in art,
          the pure <span>“æsthetes,”</span> like to
          ignore.—Moreover, almost all music has a magical effect only when
          we hear it speak the language of our own <em><span>past</span></em>.
          Accordingly, it seems to the layman that all the old music is
          continually growing better, and that all the latest is of little
          value. For the latter arouses no <span>“sentimentality,”</span> that most essential element of
          happiness, as aforesaid, for every man who cannot approach this art
          with pure æsthetic enjoyment.</p>

<p><span><span>As Friends of
          Music.</span></span>—Ultimately we are and remain good friends with
          music, as we are with the light of the moon. Neither, after all,
          tries to supplant the sun: they only want to illumine our nights to
          the best of their powers. Yet we may jest and laugh at them, may we
          not? Just a little, at least, and from time to time? At the man in
          the moon, at the woman in the music?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>170.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Art in an Age
          of Work.</span></span>—We have the conscience of an industrious
          epoch. This debars us from devoting our best hours and the best
          part of our days to art, even though that art be the greatest and
          worthiest. Art is for us a matter of leisure, of recreation, and we
          consecrate to it the <em><span>residue</span></em> of our time and strength.
          This is the cardinal fact that has altered the relation of art to
          life. When art makes its great demands of time and strength upon
          its recipients, it has to battle against the conscience of the
          industrious and efficient, it is relegated to the idle and conscienceless,
          who, by their very nature, are not exactly suited to great art, and
          consider its claims arrogant. It might, therefore, be all over with
          art, since it lacks air and the power to breathe. But perhaps the
          great art attempts, by a sort of coarsening and disguising, to make
          itself at home in that other atmosphere, or at least to put up with
          it—an atmosphere which is really a natural element only for petty
          art, the art of recreation, of pleasant distraction. This happens
          nowadays almost everywhere. Even the exponents of great art promise
          recreation and distraction; even they address themselves to the
          exhausted; even they demand from him the evening hours of his
          working-day—just like the artists of the entertaining school, who
          are content to smooth the furrowed brow and brighten the
          lack-lustre eye. What, then, are the devices of their mightier
          brethren? These have in their medicine-chests the most powerful
          excitants, which might give a shock even to a man half-dead: they
          can deafen you, intoxicate you, make you shudder, or bring tears to
          your eyes. By this means they overpower the exhausted man and
          stimulate him for one night to an over-lively condition, to an
          ecstasy of terror and delight. This great art, as it now lives in
          opera, tragedy, and music—have we a right to be angry with it,
          because of its perilous fascination, as we should be angry with a
          cunning courtesan? Certainly not. It would far rather live in the
          pure element of morning calm, and would far rather make its appeal
          to the fresh, expectant, vigorous morning-soul of the beholder or
          listener. Let us be thankful that it prefers living <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg278"></a> thus to vanishing altogether. But let
          us also confess that an era that once more introduces free and
          complete high-days and holidays into life will have no use for
          <em><span>our</span></em> great art.</p>

<p><span><span>The Employees
          of Science and the Others.</span></span>—Really efficient and
          successful men of science might be collectively called <span>“The Employees.”</span> If in youth their acumen is
          sufficiently practised, their memory is full, and hand and eye have
          acquired sureness, they are appointed by an older fellow-craftsman
          to a scientific position where their qualities may prove useful.
          Later on, when they have themselves gained an eye for the gaps and
          defects in their science, they place themselves in whatever
          position they are needed. These persons all exist for the sake of
          science. But there are rarer spirits, spirits that seldom succeed
          or fully mature—<span>“for whose sake science
          exists”</span>—at least, in their view. They are often unpleasant,
          conceited, or cross-grained men, but almost always prodigies to a
          certain extent. They are neither employees nor employers; they make
          use of what those others have worked out and established, with a
          certain princely carelessness and with little and rare praise—just
          as if the others belonged to a lower order of beings. Yet they
          possess the same qualities as their fellow-workers, and that
          sometimes in a less developed form. Moreover, they have a peculiar
          limitation, from which the others are free; this makes it
          impossible to put them into a place and to see in them useful
          tools. They can only live in their own air and on their own soil. This limitation
          suggests to them what elements of a science <span>“are theirs”</span>—in other words, what they can carry
          home into their house and atmosphere: they think that they are
          always collecting their scattered <span>“property.”</span> If they are prevented from building
          at their own nest, they perish like shelterless birds. The loss of
          freedom causes them to wilt away. If they show, like their
          colleagues, a fondness for certain regions of science, it is always
          only regions where the fruits and seeds necessary to them can
          thrive. What do they care whether science, taken as a whole, has
          untilled or badly tilled regions? They lack all impersonal interest
          in a scientific problem. As they are themselves personal through
          and through, all their knowledge and ideas are remoulded into a
          person, into a living complexity, with its parts interdependent,
          overlapping, jointly nurtured, and with a peculiar atmosphere and
          scent as a whole.—Such natures, with their system of personal
          knowledge, produce the illusion that a science (or even the whole
          of philosophy) is finished and has reached its goal. The life in
          their system works this magic, which at times has been fatal to
          science and deceptive to the really efficient workers above
          described, and at other times, when drought and exhaustion
          prevailed, has acted as a kind of restorative, as if it were the
          air of a cool, refreshing resting-place.—These men are usually
          called <em><span>philosophers</span></em>.</p>

          Œdipus) gouge our eyes out, so against violent physical pain we
          call to our aid a bitter, violent emotion, through the recollection
          of slanderous and malignant people, through the denigration of our
          future, through the sword-pricks and acts of malice which we
          mentally direct against the absent. And at times it is true that
          one devil drives out another—but then we have the other.—Hence a
          different sort of talk, tending to alleviate pain, should be

<p><span><span>The Great

          profound savants who are in peril of seeing their life's goal set
          ever lower and lower, and, with a feeling of this in their minds,
          to become ever more discouraged and more unendurable in the latter
          half of their lives. At first they plunge into their science with
          spacious hopes and set themselves daring tasks, the ends of which
          are already anticipated
          by their imaginations. Then there are moments as in the lives of
          the great maritime discoverers—knowledge, presentiment, and power
          raise each other higher and higher, until a new shore first dawns
          upon the eye in the far distance. But now the stern man recognises
          more and more how important it is that the individual task of the
          inquirer should be limited as far as possible, so that it may be
          entirely accomplished and the intolerable waste of force from which
          earlier periods of science suffered may be avoided. In those days
          everything was done ten times over, and then the eleventh always
          had the last and best word. Yet the more the savant learns and
          practises this art of solving riddles in their entirety, the more
          pleasure he finds in so doing. But at the same time his demands
          upon what is here called <span>“entirety”</span>
          grow more exacting. He sets aside everything that must remain in
          this sense incomplete, he acquires a disgust and an acute scent for
          the half-soluble—for all that can only give a kind of certainty in
          a general and indefinite form. His youthful plans crumble away
          before his eyes. There remains scarcely anything but a few little
          knots, in untying which the master now takes his pleasure and shows
          his strength. Then, in the midst of all this useful, restless
          activity, he, now grown old, is suddenly then often overcome by a
          deep misgiving, a sort of torment of conscience. He looks upon
          himself as one changed, as if he were diminished, humbled,
          transformed into a dexterous <em><span>dwarf</span></em>; he grows anxious as to
          whether mastery in small matters be not a convenience, an escape
          from the summons to greatness in life and form. But he cannot pass
          <em><span>beyond</span></em> any longer—the time for

<p><span><span>Vanity as the
          Greatest Utility.</span></span>—Originally the strong individual
          uses not only Nature but even societies and weaker individuals as
          objects of rapine. He exploits them, so far as he can, and then
          passes on. As he lives from hand to mouth, alternating between
          hunger and superfluity, he kills more animals than he can eat, and
          robs and maltreats men more than is necessary. His manifestation of
          power is at the same time one of revenge against his cramped and
          worried existence. Furthermore, he wishes to be held more powerful
          than he is, and thus misuses opportunities; the accretion of fear
          that he begets being an accretion of power. He soon observes that
          he stands or falls not by what he <em><span>is</span></em> but
          by what he is <em><span>thought</span></em> to be. Herein lies the
          origin of vanity. The man of power seeks by every means to increase
          others' faith in his power.—The thralls who tremble before him and
          serve him know, for their part, that they are worth just so much as they appear
          to him to be worth, and so they work with an eye to this valuation
          rather than to their own self-satisfaction. We know vanity only in
          its most weakened forms, in its idealisations and its small doses,
          because we live in a late and very emasculated state of society.
          Originally vanity is the great utility, the strongest means of
          preservation. And indeed vanity will be greater, the cleverer the
          individual, because an increase in the belief in power is easier
          than an increase in the power itself, but only for him who has
          intellect or (as must be the case under primitive conditions) who
          is cunning and crafty.</p>

<p><span><span>Weather-Signs
          of Culture.</span></span>—There are so few decisive weather-signs
          of culture that we must be glad to have at least one unfailing sign
          at hand for use in house and garden. To test whether a man belongs
          to us (I mean to the free spirits) or not, we must test his
          sentiments regarding Christianity. If he looks upon Christianity
          with other than a critical eye, we turn our backs to him, for he
          brings us impure air and bad weather.—It is no longer our task to
          teach such men what a sirocco wind is. They have Moses and the
          prophets of weather and of enlightenment. If
          they will not listen to these, then——</p>

<p><span><span>There is a

          until he has restored to the animals this gift of the
          cradle.—Herein lies buried one of the mightiest ideas that men can
          have, the idea of a progress of all progresses.—Let us go forward
          together a few millenniums, my friends! There is still reserved for
          mankind a great deal of joy, the very scent of which has not yet
          been wafted to the men of our day! Indeed, we may promise ourselves
          this joy, nay summon and conjure it up as a necessary thing, so
          long as the development of human reason does not stand still. Some
          day we shall no longer be reconciled to the logical sin that lurks
          in all wrath and punishment, whether exercised by the individual or
          by society—some day, when head and heart have learnt to live as
          near together as they now are far apart. That they no longer stand
          so far apart as they did originally is fairly palpable from a
          glance at the whole course of humanity. The individual who can
          review a life of introspective work will become conscious of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span>rapprochement</span></span> arrived at, with a
          proud delight at the distance he has bridged, in order that he may

<p><span><span>Origin of

          whether we are to look to the future with hollow eye or in hopeful
          mood. The same influence extends to the very highest and most
          intellectual states. Discontent and reviling of the world are for
          the present generation an inheritance from starveling ancestors.
          Even in our artists and poets we often notice that, however exuberant their life, they are
          not of good birth, and have often, from oppressed and ill-nourished
          ancestors, inherited in their blood and brain much that comes out
          as the subject and even the conscious colouring of their work. The
          culture of the Greeks is a culture of men of wealth, in fact,
          inherited wealth. For a few centuries they lived better than we do
          (better in every sense, in particular far more simply in food and
          drink). Then the brain finally became so well-stored and subtle,
          and the blood flowed so quickly, like a joyous, clear wine, that
          the best in them came to light no longer as gloomy, distorted, and
          violent, but full of beauty and sunshine.</p>

<p><span><span>Of Reasonable
          Death.</span></span>—Which is more reasonable, to stop the machine
          when the works have done the task demanded of them, or to let it
          run on until it stands still of its own accord—in other words, is
          destroyed? Is not the latter a waste of the cost of upkeep, a
          misuse of the strength and care of those who serve? Are men not
          here throwing away that which would be sorely needed elsewhere? Is
          not a kind of contempt of the machines propagated, in that many of
          them are so uselessly tended and kept up?—I am speaking of
          involuntary (natural) and voluntary (reasonable) death. Natural
          death is independent of all reason and is really an irrational
          death, in which the pitiable substance of the shell determines how
          long the kernel is to exist or not; in which, accordingly, the
          stunted, diseased and dull-witted jailer is lord, and indicates the moment at
          which his distinguished prisoner shall die. Natural death is the
          suicide of nature—in other words, the annihilation of the most
          rational being through the most irrational element that is attached
          thereto. Only through religious illumination can the reverse
          appear; for then, as is equitable, the higher reason (God) issues
          its orders, which the lower reason has to obey. Outside religious
          thought natural death is not worth glorifying. The wise
          dispensation and disposal of death belongs to that now quite
          incomprehensible and immoral-sounding morality of the future, the
          dawn of which it will be an ineffable delight to behold.</p>

<p><span><span>Retrograde

          earlier stages of culture than that in which they are placed for
          the time being. Their influence is retrograde. Let us consider the
          tools that society must forge and maintain for its defence: the
          cunning detectives, the jailers, the hangmen. Nor should we forget
          the public counsel for prosecution and defence. Finally we may ask
          ourselves whether the judge himself and punishment and the whole
          legal procedure are not oppressive rather than elevating in their
          reaction upon all who are not law-breakers. For we shall never
          succeed in arraying self-defence and revenge in the garb of
          innocence, and so long as men are used and sacrificed as a means to
          the end of society, all loftier humanity will deplore this
          necessity.</p>

<p><span><span>War as a

          contemptible war may be prescribed as a remedy, if indeed they
          really want to go on living. National consumption as well as
          individual admits of a brutal cure. The eternal will to live and
          inability to die is, however, in itself already a sign of senility
          of emotion. The more fully and thoroughly we live, the more ready
          we are to sacrifice life for a single pleasurable emotion. A people
          that lives and feels in this wise has no need of war.</p>

<p><span><span>Intellectual
          and Physical Transplantation as Remedies.</span></span>—The
          different cultures are so many intellectual climates, every one of
          which is peculiarly harmful or beneficial to this or that organism.
          History as a whole, as the knowledge of different cultures, is the
          science of remedies, but not the science of the healing art itself.
          We still need a physician who can make use of these remedies, in
          order to send every one—temporarily or permanently—to the climate
          that just suits him. To live in the present, within the limits of a
          single culture, is insufficient as a universal remedy: too many
          highly useful kinds of men, who cannot breathe freely in this
          atmosphere, would perish. With the aid of history we must give them
          air and try to preserve them: even men of lower cultures have their
          value.—Add to this cure of intellects that humanity, on
          considerations of bodily health, must strive to discover by means
          of a medical geography what kinds of degeneration and disease are caused by each region of
          the earth, and conversely, what ingredients of health the earth
          affords: and then, gradually, nations, families, and individuals
          must be transplanted long and permanently enough for them to become
          masters of their inherited physical infirmities. The whole world
          will finally be a series of sanatoria.</p>

<p><span><span>Reason and the
          Tree of Mankind.</span></span>—What you all fear in your senile
          short-sightedness, regarding the over-population of the world,
          gives the more hopeful a mighty task. Man is some day to become a
          tree overshadowing the whole earth, with millions upon millions of
          buds that shall all grow to fruits side by side, and the earth
          itself shall be prepared for the nourishment of this tree. That the
          shoot, tiny as yet, may increase in sap and strength; that the sap
          may flow in countless channels for the nutrition of the whole and
          the parts—from these and similar tasks we must derive our standard
          for measuring whether a man of to-day is useful or worthless. The
          task is unspeakably great and adventurous: let us all contribute
          our share to prevent the tree from rotting before its time! The
          historically trained mind will no doubt succeed in calling up the
          human activities of all the ages before its eyes, as the community
          of ants with its cunningly wrought mounds stands before our eyes.
          Superficially judged, mankind as a whole, like ant-kind, might
          admit of our speaking of <span>“instinct.”</span>
          On a closer examination we observe how whole nations, nay whole centuries, take pains to
          discover and test new means of benefiting the great mass of
          humanity, and thus finally the great common fruit-tree of the
          world. Whatever injury the individual nations or periods may suffer
          in this testing process, they have each become wise through this
          injury, and from them the tide of wisdom slowly pours over the
          principles of whole races and whole epochs. Ants too go astray and
          make blunders. Through the folly of its remedies, mankind may well
          go to rack and ruin before the proper time. There is no sure
          guiding instinct for the former or the latter. Rather must we
          boldly face the great task of preparing the earth for a plant of
          the most ample and joyous fruitfulness—a task set by reason to
          reason!</p>

<p><span><span>The Praise of
          Disinterestedness and its Origin.</span></span>—Between two
          neighbouring chieftains there was a long-standing quarrel: they
          laid waste each other's territories, stole cattle, and burnt down
          houses, with an indecisive result on the whole, because their power
          was fairly equal. A third, who from the distant situation of his
          property was able to keep aloof from these feuds, yet had reason to
          dread the day when one of the two neighbours should gain a decisive
          preponderance, at last intervened between the combatants with
          ceremonial goodwill. Secretly he lent a heavy weight to his peace
          proposal by giving either to understand that he would henceforth
          join forces with the other against the one who strove to break the
          peace. They met in his presence, they hesitatingly placed into his hand
          the hands that had hitherto been the tools and only too often the
          causes of hatred—and then they really and seriously tried to keep
          the peace. Either saw with astonishment how suddenly his prosperity
          and his comfort increased; how he now had as neighbour a dealer
          ready to buy and sell instead of a treacherous or openly scornful
          evil-doer; how even, in unforeseen troubles, they could
          reciprocally save each other from distress, instead of, as before,
          making capital out of this distress of his neighbour and enhancing
          it to the highest degree. It even seemed as if the human type had
          improved in both countries, for the eyes had become brighter, the
          forehead had lost its wrinkles; all now felt confidence in the
          future—and nothing is more advantageous for the souls and bodies of
          men than this confidence. They saw each other every year on the
          anniversary of the alliance, the chieftains as well as their
          retinue, and indeed before the eyes of the mediator, whose mode of
          action they admired and revered more and more, the greater the
          profit that they owed to him became. Then his mode of action was
          called <em><span>disinterested</span></em>. They had looked far
          too fixedly at the profit they had reaped themselves hitherto to
          see anything more of their neighbour's method of dealing than that
          his condition in consequence of this had not altered so much as
          their own; he had rather remained the same: and thus it appeared
          that the former had not had his profit in view. For the first time
          people said to themselves that disinterestedness was a virtue. It
          is true that in minor private matters similar circumstances
          had arisen, but men
          only had eyes for this virtue when it was depicted on the walls in
          a large script that was legible to the whole community. Moral
          qualities are not recognised as virtues, endowed with names, held
          in esteem, and recommended as worthy of acquisition until the
          moment when they have <em><span>visibly</span></em> decided the happiness and
          destiny of whole societies. For then the loftiness of sentiment and
          the excitation of the inner creative forces is in many so great,
          that offerings are brought to this quality, offerings from the best
          of what each possesses. At its feet the serious man lays his
          seriousness, the dignified man his dignity, women their gentleness,
          the young all the wealth of hope and futurity that in them lies;
          the poet lends it words and names, sets it marching in the
          procession of similar beings, gives it a pedigree, and finally, as
          is the way of artists, adores the picture of his fancy as a new
          godhead—he even teaches others to adore. Thus in the end, with the
          co-operation of universal love and gratitude, a virtue becomes,
          like a statue, a repository of all that is good and honourable, a
          sort of temple and divine personage combined. It appears
          thenceforward as an individual virtue, as an absolute entity, which
          it was not before, and exercises the power and privileges of a
          sanctified super-humanity.—In the later days of Greece the cities
          were full of such deified human abstractions (if one may so call
          them). The nation, in its own fashion, had set up a Platonic
          <span>“Heaven of Ideas”</span> on earth, and I do
          not think that its inhabitants were felt to be less alive than any

          our experiences or expectations or relations with poetic boldness
          and definiteness, so that in the morning we are always astonished
          at ourselves when we remember the nature of our dream. In dreams we

          for this purpose. The working of the most fertile soils requires an
          enormous, carefully developed, persevering method, tangible
          individual results, and an organised body of well-trained workers.
          All these are found together only at a late stage.—Impatience and
          ambition often grasp too early at these most fertile soils, but the
          results are then from the first null and void. In nature such

<p><span><span>Being Ashamed

          very rich, we at once feel a similar sentiment to that experienced
          at the sight of a repulsively swollen invalid, one suffering from
          diabetes or dropsy. We must with an effort remember our humanity,
          in order to go about with this rich man in such a way that he does
          not notice our feeling of disgust. But as soon as he prides himself
          at all on his wealth, our feelings are mingled with an almost
          compassionate surprise at such a high degree of human unreason. We
          would fain raise our hands to heaven and cry, <span>“Poor deformed and overburdened creature, fettered a
          hundredfold, to whom every hour brings or may bring something
          unpleasant, in whose frame twitches every event that occurs in
          scores of countries, how can you make us believe that you feel at
          ease in your position? If you appear anywhere in public, we know
          that it is a sort of running the gauntlet amid countless glances
          that have for you only cold hate or importunity or silent scorn.
          You may earn more easily than others, but it is only a superfluous
          earning, which brings little joy, and the guarding of what you have
          earned is now, at any rate, a more troublesome business than any
          toilsome process of earning. You are continually suffering, because
          you are continually losing. What avails it you that they are always
          injecting you with fresh artificial blood? That does not relieve
          the pain of those cupping-glasses that are fixed, for ever fixed,
          on your neck!—But, to be quite fair to you, it is difficult or
          perhaps impossible for you <em><span>not</span></em> to be rich. You <em><span>must</span></em>
          guard, you <em><span>must</span></em> earn more; the inherited bent
          of your character is the yoke fastened upon you. But do not on that account
          deceive us—be honestly and visibly ashamed of the yoke you wear, as
          in your soul you are weary and unwilling to wear it. This shame is

          is generally not satisfied with refuting it and drawing out of it
          the illogical worm that resides within. Rather, when the worm has
          been killed, does he throw the whole fruit as well into the mire,
          in order to make it ignoble in men's sight and to inspire disgust.
          Thus he thinks that he has found a means of making the usual
          <span>“third-day resurrection”</span> of
          conceptions an impossibility.—He is wrong, for on the very soil of
          insult, in the midst of the filth, the kernel of the conception
          soon produces new seeds.—The right thing then, is not to scorn and
          bespatter what one wishes finally to remove, but to lay it tenderly
          on ice again and again, having regard to the fact that conceptions
          are very tenacious of life. Here we must act according to the

          This, however, is not the case with the individual virtues,
          moderation, justice, repose; for the greatest freedom of the
          conscious intellect leads at some time, even unconsciously, back to
          these virtues, and then enjoins their practice as expedient.</p>

<p><span><span>The Fanatic of
          Distrust and His Surety.</span></span>—<span><span>The

          instruct mankind in the great things? What is your surety?</p>
<p><span><span>Pyrrho</span></span>:
          It is this: I intend to warn men against myself; I intend to
          confess all the defects of my character quite openly, and reveal to
          the world my hasty conclusions, my contradictions, and my foolish
          blunders. <span>“Do not listen to me,”</span> I
          will say to them, <span>“until I have become
          equal to the meanest among you, nay am even less than he. Struggle
          against truth as long as you can, from your disgust with her
          advocate. I shall be your seducer and betrayer if you find in me
          the slightest glimmering of respectability and dignity.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>The

          burden.</p>
<p><span><span>Pyrrho</span></span>:
          Then I will tell men even that, and say that I am too weak, and
          cannot keep my promise. The greater my unworthiness, the more will
          they mistrust the truth,
          when it passes through my lips.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Elder</span></span>: You propose to teach distrust of truth?</p>
<p><span><span>Pyrrho</span></span>:
          Yes; distrust as it never was yet on earth, distrust of anything
          and everything. This is the only road to truth. The right eye must
          not trust the left eye, and for some time light must be called
          darkness: this is the path that you must tread. Do not imagine that
          it will lead you to fruit trees and fair pastures. You will find on
          this road little hard grains—these are truths. For years and years
          you will have to swallow handfuls of lies, so as not to die of
          hunger, although you know that they are lies. But those grains will
          be sown and planted, and perhaps, perhaps some day will come the
          harvest. No one may <em><span>promise</span></em> that day, unless he be a
          fanatic.</p>
<p><span><span>The

          fanatic!</p>
<p><span><span>Pyrrho</span></span>:
          You are right! I will be distrustful of all words.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Elder</span></span>: Then you will have to be silent.</p>
<p><span><span>Pyrrho</span></span>:
          I shall tell men that I have to be silent, and that they are to
          mistrust my silence.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Elder</span></span>: So you draw back from your undertaking?</p>
<p><span><span>Pyrrho</span></span>:
          On the contrary—you have shown me the door through which I must
          pass.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Elder</span></span>: I don't know whether we yet completely
          understand each other?</p>

<p><span><span>European
          Books.</span></span>—In reading Montaigne, La Rochefoucauld, La
          Bruyère, Fontenelle (especially the <span><span>Dialogues des
          Morts</span></span>), Vauvenargues, and Chamfort we are nearer to
          antiquity than in any group of six authors of other nations.
          Through these six the spirit of the last centuries before Christ
          has once more come into being, and they collectively form an
          important link in the great and still continuous chain of the
          Renaissance. Their books are raised above all changes of national
          taste and philosophical nuances from which as a rule every book
          takes and must take its hue in order to become famous. They contain
          more real ideas than all the books of German philosophers put
          together: ideas of the sort that breed ideas——I am at a loss how to
          define to the end: enough to say that they appear to me writers who
          wrote neither for children nor for visionaries, neither for virgins
          nor for Christians, neither for Germans nor for—I am again at a
          loss how to finish my list. To praise them in plain terms, I may
          say that had they been written in Greek, they would have been
          understood by Greeks. How much, on the other hand, would even a
          Plato have understood of the writings of our best German
          thinkers—Goethe and Schopenhauer, for instance—to say nothing of
          the repugnance that he would have felt to their style, particularly to its obscure,
          exaggerated, and occasionally dry-as-dust elements? And these are
          defects from which these two among German thinkers suffer least and
          yet far too much (Goethe as thinker was fonder than he should have
          been of embracing the cloud, and Schopenhauer almost constantly
          wanders, not with impunity, among symbols of objects rather than
          among the objects themselves).—On the other hand, what clearness
          and graceful precision there is in these Frenchmen! The Greeks,
          whose ears were most refined, could not but have approved of this
          art, and one quality they would even have admired and
          reverenced—the French verbal wit: they were extremely fond of this
          quality, without being particularly strong in it themselves.</p>

<p><span><span>Fashion and
          Modernity.</span></span>—Wherever ignorance, uncleanness, and
          superstition are still rife, where communication is backward,
          agriculture poor, and the priesthood powerful, national costumes
          are still worn. Fashion, on the other hand, rules where the
          opposite conditions prevail. Fashion is accordingly to be found
          next to the virtues in modern Europe. Are we to call it their seamy
          side?—Masculine dress that is fashionable and no longer national
          proclaims of its wearer: firstly, that he does not wish to appear
          as an individual or as member of a class or race; that he has made
          an intentional suppression of these kinds of vanity a law unto
          himself: secondly, that he is a worker, and has little time for
          dressing and self-adornment, and moreover regards anything expensive or
          luxurious in material and cut as out of harmony with his work:
          lastly, that by his clothes he indicates the more learned and
          intellectual callings as those to which he stands or would like to
          stand nearest as a European—whereas such national costumes as still
          exist would exhibit the occupations of brigand, shepherd, and
          soldier as the most desirable and distinguished. Within this
          general character of masculine fashion exist the slight
          fluctuations demanded by the vanity of young men, the dandies and
          dawdlers of our great cities—in other words, Europeans who have not
          yet reached maturity.—European women are as yet far less mature,
          and for this reason the fluctuations with them are much greater.
          They also will not have the national costume, and hate to be
          recognised by their dress as German, French, or Russian. They are,
          however, very desirous of creating an impression as individuals.
          Then, too, their dress must leave no one in doubt that they belong
          to one of the more reputable classes of society (to <span>“good”</span> or <span>“high”</span>
          or <span>“great”</span> society), and on this
          score their pretensions are all the greater if they belong scarcely
          or not at all to that class. Above all, the young woman does not
          want to wear what an older woman wears, because she thinks she
          loses her market value if she is suspected of being somewhat
          advanced in years. The older woman, on the other hand, would like
          to deceive the world as long as possible by a youthful garb. From
          this competition must continually arise temporary fashions, in
          which the youthful element is unmistakably and inimitably apparent. But
          after the inventive genius of the young female artists has run riot
          for some time in such indiscreet revelations of youth (or rather,
          after the inventive genius of older, courtly civilisations and of
          still existing peoples—in fact, of the whole world of dress—has
          been pressed into the service, and, say, the Spaniards, Turks, and
          ancient Greeks have been yoked together for the glorification of
          fair flesh), then they at last discover, time and again, that they
          have not been good judges of their own interest; that if they wish
          to have power over men, the game of hide-and-seek with the
          beautiful body is more likely to win than naked or half-naked
          honesty. And then the wheel of taste and vanity turns once more in
          an opposite direction. The rather older young women find that their
          kingdom has come, and the competition of the dear, absurd creatures
          rages again from the beginning.—But the more women advance
          mentally, and no longer among themselves concede the pre-eminence
          to an unripe age, the smaller their fluctuations of costume grow
          and the less elaborate their adornment. A just verdict in this
          respect must not be based on ancient models—in other words, not on
          the standard of the dress of women who dwell on the shores of the
          Mediterranean—but must have an eye to the climatic conditions of
          the central and northern regions, where the intellectual and
          creative spirit of Europe now finds its most natural
          home.—Generally speaking, therefore, it is not change that will be
          the characteristic mark of fashion and modernity, for change is
          retrograde, and betokens <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg
          306]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg306"></a>
          the still unripened men and women of Europe; but rather the
          repudiation of national, social, and individual vanity.
          Accordingly, it is commendable, because involving a saving of time
          and strength, if certain cities and districts of Europe think and
          invent for all the rest in the matter of dress, in view of the fact
          that a sense of form does not seem to have been bestowed upon all.
          Nor is it really an excessive ambition, so long as these
          fluctuations still exist, for Paris, for example, to claim to be
          the sole inventor and innovator in this sphere. If a German, from
          hatred of these claims on the part of a French city, wishes to
          dress differently,—as, for example, in the Dürer style,—let him
          reflect that he then has a costume which the Germans of olden times
          wore, but which the Germans have not in the slightest degree
          invented. For there has never been a style of dress that
          characterised the German as a German. Moreover, let him observe how
          he looks in his costume, and whether his altogether modern face,
          with all its hues and wrinkles, does not raise a protest against a
          Dürer fashion of dress.—Here, where the concepts <span>“modern”</span> and <span>“European”</span> are almost identical, we understand
          by <span>“Europe”</span> a far wider region than
          is embraced by the Europe of geography, the little peninsula of
          Asia. In particular, we must include America, in so far as America
          is the daughter of our civilisation. On the other hand, not all
          Europe falls under the heading of cultured <span>“Europe,”</span> but only those nations and divisions
          of nations which have their common past in Greece, Rome, Judaism,
          and Christianity.</p>

<p><span><span><span>“</span><span>German Virtue.</span><span>”</span></span></span>—There is no
          denying that from the end of the eighteenth century a current of
          moral awakening flowed through Europe. Then only Virtue found again
          the power of speech. She learnt to discover the unrestrained
          gestures of exaltation and emotion, she was no longer ashamed of
          herself, and she created philosophies and poems for her own
          glorification. If we look for the sources of this current, we come
          upon Rousseau, but the mythical Rousseau, the phantom formed from
          the impression left by his writings (one might almost say again,
          his mythically interpreted writings) and by the indications that he
          provided himself. He and his public constantly worked at the
          fashioning of this ideal figure. The other origin lies in the
          resurrection of the Stoical side of Rome's greatness, whereby the
          French so nobly carried on the task of the Renaissance. With
          striking success they proceeded from the reproduction of antique
          forms to the reproduction of antique characters. Thus they may
          always claim a title to the highest honours, as the nation which
          has hitherto given the modern world its best books and its best
          men. How this twofold archetype, the mythical Rousseau and the
          resurrected spirit of Rome, affected France's weaker neighbours, is
          particularly noticeable in Germany, which, in consequence of her
          novel and quite unwonted impulse to seriousness and loftiness in
          will and self-control, finally came to feel astonishment at her own
          newfound virtue, and launched into the world the concept
          <span>“German virtue,”</span> as if this were the
          most original and hereditary of her possessions. The first great men who transfused
          into their own blood that French impulse towards greatness and
          consciousness of the moral will were more honest, and more
          grateful. Whence comes the moralism of Kant? He is continually
          reminding us: from Rousseau and the revival of Stoic Rome. The
          moralism of Schiller has the same source and the same glorification
          of the source. The moralism of Beethoven in notes is a continual
          song in praise of Rousseau, the antique French, and Schiller.
          <span>“Young Germany”</span> was the first to
          forget its gratitude, because in the meantime people had listened
          to the preachers of hatred of the French. The <span>“young German”</span> came to the fore with more
          consciousness than is generally allowed to youths. When he
          investigated his paternity, he might well think of the proximity of
          Schiller, Schleiermacher, and Fichte. But he should have looked for
          his grandfathers in Paris and Geneva, and it was very short-sighted
          of him to believe what he believed: that virtue was not more than
          thirty years old. People became used to demanding that the word
          <span>“German”</span> should connote <span>“virtue,”</span> and this process has not been wholly
          forgotten to this day.—Be it observed further that this moral
          awakening, as may almost be guessed, has resulted only in drawbacks
          and obstacles to the <em><span>recognition</span></em> of moral phenomena.
          What is the entire German philosophy, starting from Kant, with all
          its French, English, and Italian offshoots and by-products? A
          semi-theological attack upon Helvetius, a rejection of the slowly
          and laboriously acquired views and signposts of the right road,
          which in the end he collected and expressed so well. To this day Helvetius is the
          best-abused of all good moralists and good men in Germany.</p>

<p><span><span>Classic and
          Romantic.</span></span>—Both classically and romantically minded
          spirits—two species that always exist—cherish a vision of the
          future; but the former derive their vision from the strength of
          their time, the latter from its weakness.</p>

<p><span><span>The Machine as
          Teacher.</span></span>—Machinery teaches in itself the dovetailed
          working of masses of men, in activities where each has but one
          thing to do. It is the model of party organisations and of warfare.
          On the other hand, it does not teach individual self-glorification,
          for it makes of the many a machine, and of each individual a tool
          for one purpose. Its most general effect is to teach the advantage
          of centralisation.</p>

<p><span><span>Unable to
          Settle.</span></span>—One likes to live in a small town. But from
          time to time just this small town drives us out into bare and
          lonely Nature, especially when we think we know it too well.
          Finally, in order to refresh ourselves from Nature, we go to the
          big town. A few draughts from this cup and we see its dregs, and
          the circle begins afresh, with the small town as starting-point.—So
          the moderns live; they are in all things rather too thorough to be able to settle
          like the men of other days.</p>

<p><span><span>Reaction
          against the Civilisation of Machinery.</span></span>—The machine,
          itself a product of the highest mental powers, sets in motion
          hardly any but the lower, unthinking forces of the men who serve
          it. True, it unfetters a vast quantity of force which would
          otherwise lie dormant. But it does not communicate the impulse to
          climb higher, to improve, to become artistic. It creates activity
          and monotony, but this in the long-run produces a counter-effect, a
          despairing ennui of the soul, which through machinery has learnt to
          hanker after the variety of leisure.</p>

<p><span><span>The Danger of
          Enlightenment.</span></span>—All the half-insane, theatrical,
          bestially cruel, licentious, and especially sentimental and
          self-intoxicating elements which go to form the true revolutionary
          substance, and became flesh and spirit, before the revolution, in
          Rousseau—all this composite being, with factitious enthusiasm,
          finally set even <span>“enlightenment”</span>
          upon its fanatical head, which thereby began itself to shine as in
          an illuminating halo. Yet, enlightenment is essentially foreign to
          that phenomenon, and, if left to itself, would have pierced
          silently through the clouds like a shaft of light, long content to
          transfigure individuals alone, and thus only slowly transfiguring
          national customs and institutions as well. But now, bound hand and
          foot to a violent and abrupt monster, enlightenment itself became violent and abrupt. Its
          danger has therefore become almost greater than its useful quality
          of liberation and illumination, which it introduced into the great
          revolutionary movement. Whoever grasps this will also know from
          what confusion it has to be extricated, from what impurities to be
          cleansed, in order that it may then by itself continue the work of
          enlightenment and also nip the revolution in the bud and nullify
          its effects.</p>

<span>222.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Passion in the
          Middle Ages.</span></span>—The Middle Ages are the period of great
          passions. Neither antiquity nor our period possesses this widening
          of the soul. Never was the capacity of the soul greater or measured
          by larger standards. The physical, primeval sensuality of the
          barbarian races and the over-soulful, over-vigilant, over-brilliant
          eyes of Christian mystics, the most childish and youthful and the
          most over-ripe and world-weary, the savageness of the beast of prey
          and the effeminacy and excessive refinement of the late antique
          spirit—all these elements were then not seldom united in one and
          the same person. Thus, if a man was seized by a passion, the
          rapidity of the torrent must have been greater, the whirl more
          confused, the fall deeper than ever before.—We modern men may be
          content to feel that we have suffered a loss here.</p>

<p><span><span>Robbing and

          German Reformation made progress.</p>

<p><span><span>Gladsome
          Souls.</span></span>—When even a remote hint of drink, drunkenness,
          and an evil-smelling kind of jocularity was given, the souls of the
          old Germans waxed gladsome. Otherwise they were depressed, but here
          they found something they really understood.</p>

<p><span><span>Debauchery at
          Athens.</span></span>—Even when the fish-market of Athens acquired
          its thinkers and poets, Greek debauchery had a more idyllic and
          refined appearance than Roman or German debauchery ever had. The
          voice of Juvenal would have sounded there like a hollow trumpet,
          and would have been answered by a good-natured and almost childish
          outburst of laughter.</p>
</div>
<div>

<span>226.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Cleverness of
          the Greek.</span></span>—As the desire for victory and pre-eminence
          is an ineradicable trait of human nature, older and more primitive
          than any respect of or joy in equality, the Greek State sanctioned
          gymnastic and artistic competitions among equals. In other words,
          it marked out an arena where this impulse to conquer would find a
          vent without jeopardising the political order. With the final
          decline of gymnastic and artistic contests the Greek State fell
          into a condition of profound unrest and dissolution.</p>

          lived in all periods, and lives yet, unbeknown to those who called
          and still call themselves Epicureans, and without repute among
          philosophers. He has himself even forgotten his own name—that was
          the heaviest luggage that he ever cast off.</p>

<p><span><span>The Style of
          Superiority.</span></span>—<span>“University
          slang,”</span> the speech of the German students, has its origin
          among the students who do not study. The latter know how to acquire
          a preponderance over their more serious fellows by exposing all the
          farcical elements of culture, respectability, erudition, order, and
          moderation, and by having words taken from these realms always on
          their lips, like the better and more learned students, but with
          malice in their glance and an accompanying grimace. This language
          of superiority—the only one that is original in Germany—is nowadays
          unconsciously used by statesmen and newspaper critics as well. It
          is a continual process of ironical quotation, a restless,
          cantankerous squinting of the eye right and left, a language of
          inverted commas and grimaces.</p>

          personal misgivings, as if the political and social conditions of
          the day did not satisfy us; rather because by our retirement we try
          to save and collect forces which will some day be urgently needed by culture,
          the more this present is <em><span>this present</span></em>, and, as such,
          fulfils its task. We form a capital and try to make it secure, but,

<p><span><span>Tyrants of the

          single moral trait so thoroughly as the characters of Theophrastus
          and Molière do, would be considered ill, and be spoken of as
          possessing <span>“a fixed idea.”</span> The
          Athens of the third century, if we could visit it, would appear to
          us populated by fools. Nowadays the democracy of ideas rules in
          every brain—there the multitude collectively is lord. A single idea
          that tried to be lord is now called, as above stated, <span>“a fixed idea.”</span> This is our method of murdering
          tyrants—we hint at the madhouse.</p>

<span>231.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Most
          Dangerous Emigration.</span></span>—In Russia there is an
          emigration of the intelligence. People cross the frontier in order
          to read and write good books. Thus, however, they are working
          towards turning their country, abandoned by the intellect, into a
          gaping Asiatic maw, which would fain swallow our little Europe.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>232.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Political
          Fools.</span></span>—The almost religious love of the king was
          transferred by the Greeks, when the monarchy was abolished, to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="el"><span>polis</span></span>. An idea can be loved more
          than a person, and does not thwart the lover so often as a beloved
          human being (for the more men know themselves to be loved, the less
          considerate they usually become, until they are no longer worthy of
          love, and a rift really arises). Hence the reverence for State and
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="el"><span>polis</span></span> was greater than the
          reverence for princes had ever been. The Greeks are the political

<p><span><span>Great Works and

<p><span><span>The Sociable

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>236.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Shutting the
          Mind's Eyes.</span></span>—If we are practised and accustomed to
          reflect upon our actions, we must nevertheless close the inner eye while performing an action
          (be this even only writing letters or eating or drinking). Even in
          conversation with average people we must know how to obscure our
          own mental vision in order to attain and grasp average thinking.
          This shutting of the eyes is a conscious act and can be achieved by
          the will.</p>

<h2>
<span>237.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Most
          Terrible Revenge.</span></span>—If we wish to take a thorough
          revenge upon an opponent, we must wait until we have our hand quite
          full of truths and equities, and can calmly use the whole lot
          against him. Hence the exercise of revenge may be identified with
          the exercise of equity. It is the most terrible kind of revenge,
          for there is no higher court to which an appeal can be made. Thus
          did Voltaire revenge himself on Piron, with five lines that sum up
          Piron's whole life, work, and character: every word is a truth. So
          too he revenged himself upon Frederick the Great in a letter to him
          from Ferney.</p>

<p><span><span>Taxes of

          is also to be had there cheap, but seldom finds a customer—articles
          of luxury that minister to pleasure. Thus luxury lays a constant
          tax upon the man of simple life who does without luxuries.</p>

<p><span><span>How the Thinker
          Makes Use of a Conversation.</span></span>—Without being
          eavesdroppers, we can hear a good deal if we are able to see well,
          and at the same time to let ourselves occasionally get out of our
          own sight. But people do not know how to make use of a
          conversation. They pay far too much attention to what <em><span>they</span></em>
          want to say and reply, whereas the true listener is often contented
          to make a provisional answer and to say something merely as a
          payment on account of politeness, but on the other hand, with his
          memory lurking in ambush, carries away with him all that the other
          said, together with his tones and gestures in speaking.—In ordinary
          conversation every one thinks <em><span>he</span></em> is the leader, just as if two
          ships, sailing side by side and giving each other a slight push
          here and there, were each firmly convinced that the other ship was
          following or even being towed.</p>

<span>242.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Art of
          Excusing Oneself.</span></span>—If some one excuses himself to us,

          culprits, and experience an unpleasant emotion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>243.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Impossible
          Intercourse.</span></span>—The ship of your thoughts goes too deep
          for you to be able to travel with it in the waters of these
          friendly, decorous, obliging people. There are too many shallows
          and sandbanks: you would have to tack and turn, and would find
          yourself continually at your wits' end, and they would soon also be
          in perplexity as to <em><span>your</span></em> perplexity, the reason for
          which they cannot divine.</p>

<p><span><span>The Fox of

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>245.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>In Intimate
          Intercourse.</span></span>—However closely men are connected, there

          horizon, and at times they become aware of this fact.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>246.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Silence of
          Disgust.</span></span>—Behold! some one undergoes a thorough and
          painful transformation as thinker and human being, and makes a
          public avowal of the change. And those who hear him see nothing,
          and still believe he is the same as before! This common experience
          has already disgusted many writers. They had rated the intellectuality of mankind too
          highly, and made a vow to be silent as soon as they became aware of
          their mistake.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>247.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Business
          Seriousness.</span></span>—The business of many rich and eminent
          men is their form of recreation from too long periods of habitual

          people do in their rare moments of leisure and amusement.</p>

<span>251.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Non-Assertion
          of our Rights.</span></span>—The exertion of power is laborious and
          demands courage. That is why so many do not assert their most valid rights, because their
          rights are a kind of power, and they are too lazy or too cowardly
          to exercise them. <em><span>Indulgence</span></em> and <em><span>patience</span></em> are the names given to

<p><span><span>To the

<div>
<h2>
<span>255.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The
          Hypochondriac.</span></span>—The hypochondriac is a man who has
          just enough intellect and pleasure in the intellect to take his
          sorrows, his losses, and his mistakes seriously. But the field on
          which he grazes is too small: he crops it so close that in the end
          he has to look for single stalks. Thus he finally becomes envious
          and avaricious—and only then is he unbearable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>256.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Giving in
          Return.</span></span>—Hesiod advises us to give the neighbour who
          has helped us good measure and, if possible, fuller measure in return, as
          soon as we have the power. For this is where the neighbour's
          pleasure comes in, since his former benevolence brings him
          interest. Moreover, he who gives in return also has his pleasure,
          inasmuch as, by giving a little more than he got, he redeems the
          slight humiliation of being compelled to seek aid.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>257.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>More subtle
          than Is Necessary.</span></span>—Our sense of observation for how
          far others perceive our weaknesses is far more subtle than our
          sense of observation for the weaknesses of others. It follows that
          the first-named sense is more subtle than is necessary.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>258.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Kind of

          almost regularly find, as if bound up with him, a bright soul. This
          is, as it were, the negative shadow cast by the former.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>259.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Not to take
          Revenge.</span></span>—There are so many subtle sorts of revenge
          that one who has occasion to take revenge can really do or omit to
          do what he likes. In any case, the whole world will agree, after a
          time, that he <em><span>has</span></em> avenged himself. Hence the
          avoidance of revenge is hardly within man's power. He must not even
          so much as say that he does not <em><span>want</span></em> to
          do so, since the contempt for revenge is interpreted and felt as a
          sublime and exquisite form of revenge.—It follows that we must do
          nothing superfluous.</p>

<div>
<h2>
<span>260.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Mistake of
          Those who Pay Homage.</span></span>—Every one thinks he is paying a
          most agreeable compliment to a thinker when he says that he himself
          hit upon exactly the same idea and even upon the same expression.
          The thinker, however, is seldom delighted at hearing such news,
          nay, rather, he often becomes distrustful of his own thoughts and
          expressions. He silently resolves to revise both some day. If we
          wish to pay homage to any one, we must beware of expressing our
          agreement, for this puts us on the same level.—Often it is a matter
          of social tact to listen to an opinion as if it were not ours or
          even travelled beyond the limits of our own horizon—as, for
          example, when an old man once in a while opens the storehouse of
          his acquired knowledge.</p>

<p><span><span>Letters.</span></span>—A letter is an

          bestowed by sleep.</p>

<p><span><span>Calumny.</span></span>—If we begin to
          trace to its source a real scandalous misrepresentation, we shall
          rarely look for its origin in our honourable and straightforward
          enemies; for if they invented anything of the sort about us, they,
          as being our enemies, would gain no credence. Those, however, to
          whom for a time we have been most useful, but who, from some reason
          or other, may be secretly sure that they will obtain no more from
          us—such persons are in a position to start the ball of slander
          rolling. They gain credence, firstly, because it is assumed that
          they would invent nothing likely to do them damage; secondly,
          because they have learnt to know us intimately.—As a consolation,
          the much-slandered man may say to himself: Calumnies are diseases
          of others that break out in your body. They prove that Society is a
          (moral) organism, so that you can prescribe to <em><span>yourself</span></em> the cure that will in the

<p><span><span>The Child's
          Kingdom of Heaven.</span></span>—The happiness of a child is as
          much of a myth as the happiness of the Hyperboreans of whom the
          Greeks fabled. The Greeks supposed that, if indeed happiness dwells
          anywhere on our earth, it must certainly dwell as far as possible
          from us, perhaps over yonder at the edge of the world. Old people
          have the same thought—if man is at all capable of being happy, he
          must be happy as far as possible from our age, at the frontiers and
          beginnings of life. For many a man the sight of children, through
          the veil of this myth, is the greatest happiness that he can feel.
          He enters himself into the forecourt of heaven when he says,
          <span>“Suffer the little children to come unto
          me, for of them is the kingdom of heaven.”</span> The myth of the
          child's kingdom of heaven holds good, in some way or other,
          wherever in the modern world some sentimentality exists.</p>

<p><span><span>The
          Impatient.</span></span>—It is just the growing man who does not
          want things in the growing stage. He is too impatient for that. The
          youth will not wait until, after long study, suffering, and
          privation, his picture of men and things is complete. Accordingly,
          he confidently accepts another picture that lies ready to his hand
          and is recommended to him, and pins his faith to that, as if it
          must give him at once the lines and colours of his own painting. He
          presses a philosopher or a poet to his bosom, and must from that
          time forth perform long stretches of forced labour and renounce his
          own self. He learns much in the process, but he often forgets what
          is most worth learning and knowing—his self. He remains all his
          life a partisan. Ah, a vast amount of tedious work has to be done before you find
          your own colours, your own brush, your own canvas!—Even then you
          are very far from being a master in the art of life, but at least
          you are the boss in your own workshop.</p>

<p><span><span>There are no

          self-teaching. The instruction of the young by others is either an
          experiment performed upon something as yet unknown and unknowable,
          or else a thorough levelling process, in order to make the new
          member of society conform to the customs and manners that prevail
          for the time being. In both cases the result is accordingly
          unworthy of a thinker—the handiwork of parents and teachers, whom
          some valiantly honest person<a href="#note_25" id="noteref_25" class="pginternal"><span><span>25</span></span></a> has
          called <span>“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span>nos ennemis
          naturels</span></span>.”</span> One day, when, as the world thinks,
          we have long since finished our education, we <em><span>discover
          ourselves</span></em>. Then begins the task of the thinker, and
          then is the time to summon him to our aid—not as a teacher, but as
          a self-taught man who has experience.</p>

          the irrevocable and hopeless feelings hidden in his whole being,
          how great our sorrow would be! Why do we really suffer on this account? Because
          youth has to continue the work we have undertaken, and every flaw
          and failing in its strength is likely to injure our work, that will fall into its hands. It is the sorrow at the
          imperfect guarantee of our immortality: or, if we only feel
          ourselves as executors of the human mission, it is the sorrow that
          this mission must pass to weaker hands than ours.</p>

<span>269.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Ages of
          Life.</span></span>—The comparison of the four ages of life with
          the four seasons of the year is a venerable piece of folly. Neither
          the first twenty nor the last twenty years of a life correspond to
          a season of the year, assuming that we are not satisfied with
          drawing a parallel between white hair and snow and similar
          colour-analogies. The first twenty years are a preparation for life
          in general, for the whole year of life, a sort of long New Year's
          Day. The last twenty review, assimilate, bring into union and
          harmony all that has been experienced till then: as, in a small
          degree, we do on every New Year's Eve with the whole past year. But
          in between there really lies an interval which suggests a
          comparison with the seasons—the time from the twentieth to the
          fiftieth year (to speak here of decades in the lump, while it is an
          understood thing that every one must refine for himself these rough
          outlines). Those three decades correspond to three seasons—summer,
          spring, and autumn. Winter human life has none, unless we like to
          call the (unfortunately) often intervening hard, cold, lonely,
          hopeless, unfruitful
          periods of disease the winters of man. The twenties, hot,
          oppressive, stormy, impetuous, exhausting years, when we praise the
          day in the evening, when it is over, as we wipe the sweat from our
          foreheads—years in which work seems to us cruel but necessary—these
          twenties are the summer of life. The thirties, on the other hand,
          are its spring-time, with the air now too warm, now too cold, ever
          restless and stimulating, bubbling sap, bloom of leaves, fragrance
          of buds everywhere, many delightful mornings and evenings, work to
          which the song of birds awakens us, a true work of the heart, a
          kind of joy in our own robustness, strengthened by the savour of
          hopeful anticipation. Lastly the forties, mysterious like all that
          is stationary, like a high, broad plateau, traversed by a fresh
          breeze, with a clear, cloudless sky above it, which always has the
          same gentle look all day and half the night—the time of harvest and
          cordial gaiety—that is the autumn of life.</p>

<p><span><span>Women's

          think of men's intellect may be divined from the fact that in their
          art of adornment they think of anything but of emphasising the
          intellectual side of their faces or their single intellectual
          features. On the contrary, they conceal such traits, and
          understand, for example by an arrangement of their hair over their
          forehead, how to give themselves an appearance of vivid, eager
          sensuality and materialism, just when they but slightly possess
          those qualities. Their conviction that intellect in women frightens men goes so
          far that they even gladly deny the keenness of the most
          intellectual sense and purposely invite the reputation of
          short-sightedness. They think they will thereby make men more
          confiding. It is as if a soft, attractive twilight were spreading
          itself around them.</p>

          longer enjoys life when her husband refuses to sacrifice her. With
          all her wit, she then no longer knows—whither? and without

          <span>“leap out of their skins”</span> more

<p><span><span>The Age of
          Cyclopean Building.</span></span>—The democratisation of Europe is
          a resistless force. Even he who would stem the tide uses those very
          means that democratic thought first put into men's hands, and he
          makes these means more handy and workable. The most inveterate
          enemies of democracy (I mean the spirits of upheaval) seem only to
          exist in order, by the fear that they inspire, to drive forward the
          different parties faster and faster on the democratic course. Now
          we may well feel sorry for those who are working consciously and
          honourably for this future. There is something dreary and
          monotonous in their faces, and the grey dust seems to have been
          wafted into their very brains. Nevertheless, posterity may possibly
          some day laugh at our anxiety, and see in the democratic work of
          several generations what we see in the building of stone dams and
          walls—an activity that necessarily covers clothes and face with a
          great deal of dust, and perhaps unavoidably makes the workmen, too,
          a little dull-witted; but who would on that account desire such
          work undone? It seems that the democratisation of Europe is a link
          in the chain of those mighty prophylactic principles which are the
          thought of the modern era, and whereby we rise up in revolt against the Middle Ages. Now,
          and now only, is the age of Cyclopean building! A final security in
          the foundations, that the future may build on them without danger!
          Henceforth, an impossibility of the orchards of culture being once
          more destroyed overnight by wild, senseless mountain torrents! Dams
          and walls against barbarians, against plagues, against physical and
          spiritual serfdom! And all this understood at first roughly and
          literally, but gradually in an ever higher and more spiritual
          sense, so that all the principles here indicated may appear as the
          intellectual preparation of the highest artist in horticulture, who
          can only apply himself to his own task when the other is fully
          accomplished!—True, if we consider the long intervals of time that
          here lie between means and end, the great, supreme labour,
          straining the powers and brains of centuries, that is necessary in
          order to create or to provide each individual means, we must not
          bear too hardly upon the workers of the present when they loudly
          proclaim that the wall and the fence are already the end and the
          final goal. After all, no one yet sees the gardener and the fruit,
          for whose sake the fence exists.</p>

<h2>
<span>276.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Right of
          Universal Suffrage.</span></span>—The people has not granted itself
          universal suffrage but, wherever this is now in force, it has
          received and accepted it as a temporary measure. But in any case
          the people has the right to restore the gift, if it does not
          satisfy its anticipations. This dissatisfaction seems universal nowadays, for when, at
          any occasion where the vote is exercised, scarce two-thirds, nay
          perhaps not even the majority of all voters, go to the polls, that
          very fact is a vote against the whole suffrage system.—On this
          point, in fact, we must pronounce a much sterner verdict. A law
          that enacts that the majority shall decide as to the welfare of all
          cannot be built up on the foundation that it alone has provided,
          for it is bound to require a far broader foundation, namely the
          unanimity of all. Universal suffrage must not only be the
          expression of the will of a majority, but of the whole country.
          Thus the dissent of a very small minority is already enough to set
          aside the system as impracticable; and the abstention from voting
          is in fact a dissent of this kind, which ruins the whole
          institution. The <span>“absolute veto”</span> of
          the individual, or—not to be too minute—the veto of a few
          thousands, hangs over the system as the consequence of justice. On
          every occasion when it is employed, the system must, according to
          the variety of the division, first prove that it has still a right
          to exist.</p>

          accustomed as men of science to draw right conclusions! It is
          humiliating! Now it is clear that in the great turmoil of worldly
          doings, in political affairs, in all sudden and urgent matters such
          as almost every day brings up, these false conclusions must decide.
          For no one feels at home with novelties that have sprung up in the night. All

<p><span><span>A Drag upon

          for productive occupations, because military manœuvres and
          processions take up their days, and the rest of the population must
          feed and clothe them, their dress, however, being striking, often
          gay and full of absurdities; that there only a few distinguished
          qualities are recognised, individuals resemble each other more than
          elsewhere, or at any rate are treated as equals, yet obedience is
          exacted and yielded without reasoning, for men command and make no
          attempt to convince; that here punishments are few, but these few
          cruel and likely to become the final and most terrible; that there
          treason ranks as the capital offence, and even the criticism of
          evils is only ventured on by the most audacious; that there, again,
          human life is cheap, and ambition often takes the form of setting
          life in danger—when we hear all this, we at once say, <span>“This is a picture of a barbarous society that rests on
          a hazardous footing.”</span> One man perhaps will add, <span>“It is a portrait of Sparta.”</span> But another will
          become meditative and declare that this is a description of our modern
          military system, as it exists in the midst of our altogether
          different culture and society, a living anachronism, the picture,
          as above said, of a community resting on a hazardous footing; a
          posthumous work of the past, which can only act as a drag upon the
          wheels of the present.—Yet at times even a drag upon culture is
          vitally necessary—that is to say, when culture is advancing too
          rapidly downhill or (as perhaps in this case) <em><span>uphill</span></em>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>280.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>More Reverence
          for Them that Know.</span></span>—In the competition of production
          and sale the public is made judge of the product. But the public
          has no special knowledge, and judges by the appearance of the
          wares. In consequence, the art of appearance (and perhaps the taste
          for it) must increase under the dominance of competition, while on
          the other hand the quality of every product must deteriorate. The
          result will be—so far as reason does not fall in value—that one day
          an end will be put to that competition, and a new principle will
          win the day. Only the master of the craft should pronounce a
          verdict on the work, and the public should be dependent on the
          belief in the personality of the judge and his honesty.
          Accordingly, no anonymous work! At least an expert should be there
          as guarantor and pledge his name if the name of the creator is
          lacking or is unknown. The cheapness of an article is for the
          layman another kind of illusion and deceit, since only durability
          can decide that a thing is cheap and to what an extent. But it is difficult, and for a
          layman impossible, to judge of its durability.—Hence that which
          produces an effect on the eye and costs little at present gains the
          advantage—this being naturally machine-made work. Again,
          machinery—that is to say, the cause of the greatest rapidity and
          facility in production—favours the most saleable kind of article.
          Otherwise it involves no tangible profit; it would be too little
          used and too often stand idle. But as to what is most saleable, the
          public, as above said, decides: it must be the most exchangeable—in
          other words, the thing that appears good and also appears cheap.
          Thus in the domain of labour our motto must also hold good:
          <span>“More respect for them that
          know!”</span></p>

<p><span><span>The Danger of

          violent means, and only by a lawful pressure steadily exerted, to
          make kingship and emperorship hollow, until only a zero remains,
          perhaps with the significance of every zero in that, while nothing
          in itself, it multiplies a number tenfold if placed on the right
          side. Kingship and emperorship would remain a gorgeous ornament
          upon the simple and appropriate dress of democracy, a beautiful
          superfluity that democracy allows itself, a relic of all the
          historically venerable, primitive ornaments, nay the symbol of
          history itself, and in this unique position a highly effective
          thing if, as above said, it does not stand alone, but is put on the
          right side.—In order to avoid the danger of this nullification, kings hold by their
          teeth to their dignity as war-lords. To this end they need wars, or
          in other words exceptional circumstances, in which that slow,
          lawful pressure of the democratic forces is relaxed.</p>

          supply. For their work as middlemen they want too high a fee for
          themselves, and this is drawn from the original, productive
          spirits—namely, interest, admiration, leisure, money, and other
          advantages.—Accordingly, we should always look upon the teacher as
          a necessary evil, just like the merchant; as an evil that we should
          make as small as possible.—Perhaps the prevailing distress in
          Germany has its main cause in the fact that too many wish to live
          and live well by trade (in other words, desiring as far as possible
          to diminish prices for the producer and raise prices for the
          consumer, and thus to profit by the greatest possible loss to
          both). In the same way, we may certainly trace a main cause of the
          prevailing intellectual poverty in the superabundance of teachers.
          It is because of teachers that so little is learnt, and that so
          badly.</p>

          contest in which every one struggles and makes others struggle for
          a foot's breadth of land. In the work of the known there is
          something that cannot be bought, the sentiment and ingenuity put
          into his work for our own sake. We think we cannot better express
          our sense of obligation than by a sort of sacrifice on our
          part.—The heaviest tax is the tax of homage. The more competition
          prevails, the more we buy for the unknown and work for the unknown,
          the lower does this tax become, whereas it is really the standard
          for the loftiness of man's spiritual intercourse.</p>

<p><span><span>The Means
          towards Genuine Peace.</span></span>—No government will nowadays
          admit that it maintains an army in order to satisfy occasionally
          its passion for conquest. The army is said to serve only defensive
          purposes. This morality, which justifies self-defence, is called in
          as the government's advocate. This means, however, reserving
          morality for ourselves and immorality for our neighbour, because he
          must be thought eager for attack and conquest if our state is
          forced to consider means of self-defence.—At the same time, by our
          explanation of our need of an army (because he denies the lust of
          attack just as our state does, and ostensibly also maintains his
          army for defensive reasons), we proclaim him a hypocrite and
          cunning criminal, who would fain seize by surprise, without any
          fighting, a harmless and unwary victim. In this attitude all states face each
          other to-day. They presuppose evil intentions on their neighbour's
          part and good intentions on their own. This hypothesis, however, is
          an <em><span>inhuman</span></em> notion, as bad as and
          worse than war. Nay, at bottom it is a challenge and motive to war,
          foisting as it does upon the neighbouring state the charge of
          immorality, and thus provoking hostile intentions and acts. The
          doctrine of the army as a means of self-defence must be abjured as
          completely as the lust of conquest. Perhaps a memorable day will
          come when a nation renowned in wars and victories, distinguished by
          the highest development of military order and intelligence, and
          accustomed to make the heaviest sacrifice to these objects, will
          voluntarily exclaim, <span>“We will break our
          swords,”</span> and will destroy its whole military system, lock,
          stock, and barrel. Making ourselves defenceless (after having been
          the most strongly defended) from a loftiness of sentiment—that is
          the means towards genuine peace, which must always rest upon a
          pacific disposition. The so-called armed peace that prevails at
          present in all countries is a sign of a bellicose disposition, of a
          disposition that trusts neither itself nor its neighbour, and,
          partly from hate, partly from fear, refuses to lay down its
          weapons. Better to perish than to hate and fear, and twice as far
          better to perish than to make oneself hated and feared—this must
          some day become the supreme maxim of every political community!—Our
          liberal representatives of the people, as is well known, have not
          the time for reflection on the nature of humanity, or else they
          would know that they are working in vain when they work for <span>“a
          gradual diminution of the military burdens.”</span> On the
          contrary, when the distress of these burdens is greatest, the sort
          of God who alone can help here will be nearest. The tree of
          military glory can only be destroyed at one swoop, with one stroke
          of lightning. But, as you know, lightning comes from the cloud and
          from above.</p>

<p><span><span>Whether
          Property can be squared with Justice.</span></span>—When the
          injustice of property is strongly felt (and the hand of the great
          clock is once more at this place), we formulate two methods of
          relieving this injustice: either an equal distribution, or an
          abolition of private possession and a return to State ownership.
          The latter method is especially dear to the hearts of our
          Socialists, who are angry with that primitive Jew for saying,
          <span>“Thou shalt not steal.”</span> In their
          view the eighth<a href="#note_27" id="noteref_27" class="pginternal"><span><span>27</span></span></a>
          commandment should rather run, <span>“Thou shalt
          not possess.”</span>—The former method was frequently tried in
          antiquity, always indeed on a small scale, and yet with poor
          success. From this failure we too may learn. <span>“Equal plots of land”</span> is easily enough said, but
          how much bitterness is aroused by the necessary division and
          separation, by the loss of time-honoured possessions, how much
          piety is wounded and sacrificed! We uproot the foundation of
          morality when we uproot boundary-stones. Again, how much fresh
          bitterness among the new owners, how much envy and looking askance!
          For there have never been two really equal plots of land, and if there
          were, man's envy of his neighbour would prevent him from believing
          in their equality. And how long would this equality, unhealthy and
          poisoned at the very roots, endure? In a few generations, by
          inheritance, here one plot would come to five owners, there five
          plots to one. Even supposing that men acquiesced in such abuses
          through the enactment of stern laws of inheritance, the same equal
          plots would indeed exist, but there would also be needy
          malcontents, owning nothing but dislike of their kinsmen and
          neighbours, and longing for a general upheaval.—If, however, by the
          second method we try to restore ownership to the community and make
          the individual but a temporary tenant, we interfere with
          agriculture. For man is opposed to all that is only a transitory
          possession, unblessed with his own care and sacrifice. With such
          property he behaves in freebooter fashion, as robber or as
          worthless spendthrift. When Plato declares that self-seeking would
          be removed with the abolition of property, we may answer him that,
          if self-seeking be taken away, man will no longer possess the four
          cardinal virtues either; as we must say that the most deadly plague
          could not injure mankind so terribly as if vanity were one day to
          disappear. Without vanity and self-seeking what are human virtues?
          By this I am far from meaning that these virtues are but varied
          names and masks for these two qualities. Plato's Utopian refrain,
          which is still sung by Socialists, rests upon a deficient knowledge
          of men. He lacked the historical science of moral emotions, the
          insight into the origin of the good and useful characteristics of the human soul. He
          believed, like all antiquity, in good and evil as in black and
          white—that is to say, in a radical difference between good and bad
          men and good and bad qualities.—In order that property may
          henceforth inspire more confidence and become more moral, we should
          keep open all the paths of work for small fortunes, but should
          prevent the effortless and sudden acquisition of wealth.
          Accordingly, we should take all the branches of transport and trade
          which favour the accumulation of large fortunes—especially,
          therefore, the money market—out of the hands of private persons or
          private companies, and look upon those who own too much, just as
          upon those who own nothing, as types fraught with danger to the
          community.</p>

<p><span><span>The Value of
          Labour.</span></span>—If we try to determine the value of labour by
          the amount of time, industry, good or bad will, constraint,
          inventiveness or laziness, honesty or make-believe bestowed upon
          it, the valuation can never be a just one. For the whole
          personality would have to be thrown into the scale, and this is
          impossible. Here the motto is, <span>“Judge
          not!”</span> But after all the cry for justice is the cry we now
          hear from those who are dissatisfied with the present valuation of
          labour. If we reflect further we find every person non-responsible
          for his product, the labour; hence merit can never be derived
          therefrom, and every labour is as good or as bad as it must be
          through this or that necessary concatenation of forces and
          weaknesses, abilities and desires. The worker is not at liberty to say whether he
          shall work or not, or to decide how he shall work. Only the
          standpoints of usefulness, wider and narrower, have created the
          valuation of labour. What we at present call justice does very well
          in this sphere as a highly refined utility, which does not only
          consider the moment and exploit the immediate opportunity, but
          looks to the permanence of all conditions, and thus also keeps in
          view the well-being of the worker, his physical and spiritual
          contentment: in order that he and his posterity may work well for
          our posterity and become trustworthy for longer periods than the
          individual span of human life. The <em><span>exploitation</span></em> of the worker was, as
          we now understand, a piece of folly, a robbery at the expense of
          the future, a jeopardisation of society. We almost have the war
          now, and in any case the expense of maintaining peace, of
          concluding treaties and winning confidence, will henceforth be very
          great, because the folly of the exploiters was very great and
          long-lasting.</p>

          exemplifying rules, illustrate exceptions or stages of transition
          and extinction. We must therefore learn to look beyond actually
          existing conditions and, for example, turn our eyes to distant
          North America, where we can still contemplate and investigate, if
          we will, the initial and normal movement of the social body. In Germany such a study requires
          arduous and historical research, or, as I have suggested, a
          telescope.</p>

<p><span><span>The Victory of
          Democracy.</span></span>—All political powers nowadays attempt to
          exploit the fear of Socialism for their own strengthening. Yet in
          the long run democracy alone gains the advantage, for <em><span>all</span></em>
          parties are now compelled to flatter <span>“the
          masses”</span> and grant them facilities and liberties of all
          kinds, with the result that the masses finally become omnipotent.
          The masses are as far as possible removed from Socialism as a
          doctrine of altering the acquisition of property. If once they get
          the steering-wheel into their hands, through great majorities in
          their Parliaments, they will attack with progressive taxation the
          whole dominant system of capitalists, merchants, and financiers,
          and will in fact slowly create a middle class which may forget
          Socialism like a disease that has been overcome.—The practical
          result of this increasing democratisation will next be a European
          league of nations, in which each individual nation, delimited by
          the proper geographical frontiers, has the position of a canton
          with its separate rights. Small account will be taken of the
          historic memories of
          previously existing nations, because the pious affection for these
          memories will be gradually uprooted under the democratic régime,
          with all its craze for novelty and experiment. The corrections of
          frontiers that will prove necessary will be so carried out as to
          serve the interests of the great cantons and at the same time that
          of the whole federation, but not that of any venerable memories. To
          find the standpoints for these corrections will be the task of
          future diplomats, who will have to be at the same time students of
          civilisation, agriculturists, and commercial experts, with no
          armies but motives and utilities at their back. Then only will
          foreign and home politics be inseparably connected, whereas to-day
          the latter follows its haughty dictator, and gleans in sorry

<p><span><span>Goal and Means of Democracy.</span></span>—Democracy tries to create and guarantee
          independence for as many as possible in their opinions, way of
          life, and occupation. For this purpose democracy must withhold the
          political suffrage both from those who have nothing and from those
          who are really rich, as being the two intolerable classes of men.
          At the removal of these classes it must always work, because they
          are continually calling its task in question. In the same way
          democracy must prevent all measures that seem to aim at party
          organisation. For the three great foes of independence, in that
          threefold sense, are the have-nots, the rich, and the parties.—I speak of democracy as of a
          thing to come. What at present goes by that name is distinguished
          from older forms of government only by the fact that it drives with
          new horses; the roads and the wheels are the same as of yore.—Has
          the danger really become less with <em><span>these</span></em>

<h2>
<span>294.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Discretion and
          Success.</span></span>—That great quality of discretion, which is
          fundamentally the virtue of virtues, their ancestress and queen,
          has in common life by no means always success on its side. The
          wooer would find himself deceived if he had wooed that virtue only
          for the sake of success. For it is rated by practical people as
          suspicious, and is confused with cunning and hypocrisy: he who
          obviously lacks discretion, the man who quickly grasps and
          sometimes misses his grasp, has prejudice on his side—he is an
          honest, trustworthy fellow. Practical people, accordingly, do not
          like the prudent man, thinking he is to them a danger. Moreover, we
          often assume the prudent man to be anxious, preoccupied,
          pedantic—unpractical, butterfly people find him uncomfortable,
          because he does not live in their happy-go-lucky way, without
          thinking of actions and duties; he appears among them as their
          embodied conscience, and the bright day is dimmed to their eyes
          before his gaze. Thus when success and popularity fail him, he may
          often say by way of private consolation, <span>“So high are the taxes you have to pay for the
          possession of the most precious of human commodities—still it is worth the
          price!”</span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Et

          hills, to a milky-green lake, through firs and pines austere with
          age; rocky crags of all shapes about me, the soil gay with flowers
          and grasses. A herd of cattle moved, stretched, and expanded itself
          before me; single cows and groups in the distance, in the clearest
          evening light, hard by the forest of pines; others nearer and
          darker; all in calm and eventide contentment. My watch pointed to
          half-past six. The bull of the herd had stepped into the white
          foaming brook, and went forward slowly, now striving against, now
          giving way to his tempestuous course; thus, no doubt, he took his
          sort of fierce pleasure. Two dark brown beings, of Bergamasque
          origin, tended the herd, the girl dressed almost like a boy. On the
          left, overhanging cliffs and fields of snow above broad belts of
          woodland; to the right, two enormous ice-covered peaks, high above
          me, shimmering in the veil of the sunny haze—all large, silent, and
          bright. The beauty of the whole was awe-inspiring and induced to a
          mute worship of the moment and its revelation. Unconsciously, as if
          nothing could be more natural, you peopled this pure, clear world
          of light (which had no trace of yearning, of expectancy, of looking
          forward or backward) with Greek heroes. You felt it all as Poussin
          and his school felt—at once heroic and idyllic.—So individual men
          too have lived, constantly feeling themselves in the world and the
          world in themselves,
          and among them one of the greatest men, the inventor of a
          heroico-idyllic form of philosophy—Epicurus.</p>

          This quality is, in fact, a power of speedy mental calculation. The

          Love.</span></span>—Some one said, <span>“There

<span>302.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>How we Seek to
          Improve Bad Arguments.</span></span>—Many a man adds a bit of his
          personality to his bad arguments, as if they would thus go better
          and change into straight and good arguments. In the same way,
          players at skittles, even after a throw, try to give a direction to
          the ball by turns and gestures.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>303.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Honesty.</span></span>—It is but a small
          thing to be a pattern sort of man with regard to rights and
          property—for instance (to name trifling points, which of course give a better
          proof of this sort of pattern nature than great examples), if as a
          boy one never steals fruit from another's orchard, and as a man
          never walks on unmown fields. It is but little; you are then still
          only a <span>“law-abiding person,”</span> with
          just that degree of morality of which a <span>“society,”</span> a group of human beings, is
          capable.</p>

<span>304.</span></h2>
<p><span><span><span>“</span><span>Man!</span><span>”</span></span></span>—What is the
          vanity of the vainest individual as compared with the vanity which
          the most modest person feels when he thinks of his position in
          nature and in the world as <span>“Man!”</span></p>

<h2>
<span>305.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Most
          Necessary Gymnastic.</span></span>—Through deficiency in
          self-control in small matters a similar deficiency on great
          occasions slowly arises. Every day on which we have not at least
          once denied ourselves some <em><span>trifle</span></em> is turned to bad use and a
          danger to the next day. This gymnastic is indispensable if we wish
          to maintain the joy of being our own master.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>306.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Losing
          Ourselves.</span></span>—When we have first found ourselves, we
          must understand how from time to time to <em><span>lose</span></em>
          ourselves and then to find ourselves again.—This is true on the
          assumption that we are thinkers. A thinker finds it a drawback
          always to be tied to one person.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>307.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>When it is
          Necessary to Part.</span></span>—You must, for a time at least,
          part from that which you want to know and measure. Only when you
          have left a city do you see how high its towers rise above its
          houses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>308.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>At
          Noontide.</span></span>—He to whom an active and stormy morning of
          life is allotted, at the noontide of life feels his soul overcome
          by a strange longing for a rest that may last for months and years.
          All grows silent around him, voices sound farther and farther in
          the distance, the sun shines straight down upon him. On a hidden
          woodland sward he sees the great God Pan sleeping, and with Pan
          Nature seems to him to have gone to sleep with an expression of
          eternity on their faces. He wants nothing, he troubles about
          nothing; his heart stands still, only his eye lives. It is a death
          with waking eyes. Then man sees much that he never saw before, and,
          so far as his eye can reach, all is woven into and as it were
          buried in a net of light. He feels happy, but it is a heavy, very
          heavy kind of happiness.—Then at last the wind stirs in the trees,
          noontide is over, life carries him away again, life with its blind
          eyes, and its tempestuous retinue behind it—desire, illusion,
          oblivion, enjoyment, destruction, decay. And so comes evening, more
          stormy and more active than was even the morning.—To the really
          active man these prolonged phases of cognition seem almost uncanny
          and morbid, but not unpleasant.</p>

<p><span><span>To Beware of
          One's Portrait-Painter.</span></span>—A great painter, who in a
          portrait has revealed and put on canvas the fullest expression and
          look of which a man is capable, will almost always think, when he
          sees the man later in real life, that he is only looking at a
          caricature.</p>

<p><span><span>The Two

          Principle</span></span>: to arrange one's life on the most secure
          and tangible basis, not as hitherto upon the most distant,
          undetermined, and cloudy foundation. <span><span>Second
          Principle</span></span>: to establish the rank of the nearest and
          nearer things, and of the more and less secure, before one arranges
          one's life and directs it to a final end.</p>

<h2>
<span>311.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Dangerous
          Irritability.</span></span>—Talented men who are at the same time
          <em><span>idle</span></em> will always appear somewhat
          irritated when one of their friends has accomplished a thorough
          piece of work. Their jealousy is awakened, they are ashamed of
          their own laziness, or rather, they fear that their active friend
          will now despise them even more than before. In such a mood they
          criticise the new achievement, and, to the utter astonishment of
          the author, their criticism becomes a revenge.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>312.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Destructions of
          Illusions.</span></span>—Illusions are certainly expensive
          amusements; but the destruction of illusions is still more expensive, if
          looked upon as an amusement, as it undoubtedly is by some
          people.</p>

<p><span><span>The Monotone of
          the</span> <span><span>“</span><span>Sage.</span><span>”</span></span></span>—Cows sometimes
          have a look of wondering which stops short on the path to
          questioning. In the eye of the higher intelligence, on the other
          hand, the <span><span>nil admirari</span></span> is
          spread out like the monotony of the cloudless sky.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>314.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Not to be Ill
          too Long.</span></span>—We should beware of being ill too long. The
          lookers-on become impatient of their customary duty of showing
          sympathy, because they find it too much trouble to maintain the
          appearance of this emotion for any length of time. Then they
          immediately pass to suspicion of our character, with the
          conclusion: <span>“You deserve to be ill, and we
          need no longer be at pains to show our sympathy.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>315.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>A Hint to
          Enthusiasts.</span></span>—He who likes to be carried away, and
          would fain be carried on high, must beware lest he become too
          heavy. For instance, he must not learn much, and especially not let
          himself be crammed with science. Science makes men ponderous—take
          care, ye enthusiasts!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>316.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Knowledge of
          how to Surprise Oneself.</span></span>—He who would see himself as
          he is, must know how to <em><span>surprise</span></em> himself, torch in hand.
          For with the mind it is as with the body: whoever is accustomed to
          look at himself in the glass forgets his ugliness, and only
          recognises it again by means of the portrait-painter. Yet he even
          grows used to the picture and forgets his ugliness all over
          again.—Herein we see the universal law that man cannot endure
          unalterable ugliness, unless for a moment. He forgets or denies it
          in all cases.—The moralists must reckon upon that <span>“moment”</span> for bringing forward their truths.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>317.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Opinions and
          Fish.</span></span>—We are possessors of our opinions as of
          fish—that is, in so far as we are possessors of a fish pond. We
          must go fishing and have luck—then we have <em><span>our</span></em>
          fish, <em><span>our</span></em> opinions. I speak here of live
          opinions, of live fish. Others are content to possess a cabinet of
          fossils—and, in their head, <span>“convictions.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>318.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Signs of
          Freedom and Servitude.</span></span>—To satisfy one's needs so far
          as possible oneself, even if imperfectly, is the path towards
          freedom in mind and personality. To satisfy many even superfluous
          needs, and that as fully as possible, is a training for servitude.
          The Sophist Hippias, who himself earned and made all that he wore
          within and without, is the representative of the highest freedom of
          mind and personality. It does not matter whether all is done equally well and
          perfectly—pride can repair the damaged places.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>319.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Belief in
          Oneself.</span></span>—In our times we mistrust every one who
          believes in himself. Formerly this was enough to make people
          believe in one. The recipe for finding faith now runs: <span>“Spare not thyself! In order to set thy opinion in a
          credible light, thou must first set fire to thy own
          hut!”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>320.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>At Once Richer
          and Poorer.</span></span>—I know a man who accustomed himself even
          in childhood to think well of the intellectuality of mankind—in
          other words, of their real devotion as regards things of the
          intellect, their unselfish preference for that which is recognised
          as true—but who had at the same time a modest or even depreciatory
          view of his own brain (judgment, memory, presence of mind,
          imagination). He set no value on himself when he compared himself
          with others. Now in the course of years he was compelled, first
          once and then in a hundred ways, to revise this verdict. One would
          have thought he would be thoroughly satisfied and delighted. Such,
          in fact, was to some extent the case, but, as he once said,
          <span>“Yet a bitterness of the deepest dye is
          mingled with my feeling, such as I did not know in earlier life;
          for since I learnt to value men and myself more correctly, my
          intellect seems to me of less use. I scarcely think I can now do
          any good at all with it, because the minds of others cannot understand the good. I now
          always see before me the frightful gulf between those who could
          give help and those who need help. So I am troubled by the
          misfortune of having my intellect to myself and of being forced to
          enjoy it alone so far as it can give any enjoyment. But to give is
          more blessed than to possess, and what is the richest man in the
          solitude of a desert?”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>321.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>How we should
          Attack.</span></span>—The reasons for which men believe or do not
          believe are in very few people as strong as they might be. As a
          rule, in order to shake a belief it is far from necessary to use
          the heaviest weapon of attack. Many attain their object by merely
          making the attack with some noise—in fact, pop-guns are often
          enough. In dealing with very vain persons, the semblance of a
          strong attack is enough. They think they are being taken quite
          seriously, and readily give way.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>322.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Death.</span></span>—Through the certain
          prospect of death a precious, fragrant drop of frivolity might be
          mixed with every life—and now, you singular druggist-souls, you
          have made of death a drop of poison, unpleasant to taste, which
          makes the whole of life hideous.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>323.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Repentance.</span></span>—Never allow
          repentance free play, but say at once to yourself, <span>“That would be
          adding a second piece of folly to the first.”</span> If you have
          worked evil, you must bethink yourself of doing good. If you are
          punished for your actions, submit to the punishment with the
          feeling that by this very submission you are somehow doing good, in
          that you are deterring others from falling into the same error.
          Every malefactor who is punished has a right to consider himself a
          benefactor to mankind.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>324.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Becoming a
          Thinker.</span></span>—How can any one become a thinker if he does
          not spend at least a third part of the day without passions, men,
          and books?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>325.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Best

</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>326.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Don't
          Touch.</span></span>—There are dreadful people who, instead of
          solving a problem, complicate it for those who deal with it and
          make it harder to solve. Whoever does not know how to hit the nail on the head should be
          entreated not to hit the nail at all.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>327.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Forgetting
          Nature.</span></span>—We speak of Nature, and, in doing so, forget
          ourselves: we ourselves are Nature, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span>quand
          même</span></span>.—Consequently, Nature is something quite
          different from what we feel on hearing her name pronounced.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>328.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Profundity and
          Ennui.</span></span>—In the case of profound men, as of deep wells,
          it takes a long time before anything that is thrown into them
          reaches the bottom. The spectators, who generally do not wait long
          enough, too readily look upon such a man as callous and hard—or
          even as boring.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>329.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>When it is Time
          to Vow Fidelity to Oneself.</span></span>—We sometimes go astray in
          an intellectual direction which does not correspond to our talents.
          For a time we struggle heroically against wind and tide, really
          against ourselves; but finally we become weary and we pant. What we
          accomplish gives us no real pleasure, since we think that we have
          paid too heavy a price for these successes. We even despair of our
          productivity, of our future, perhaps in the midst of
          victory.—Finally, finally we turn back—and then the wind swells our
          sails and bears us into our smooth water. What bliss! How certain
          of victory we feel! Only now do we know what we are and what we
          intend, and now we vow fidelity to ourselves, and have a right to
          do so—as men that know.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>330.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Weather
          Prophets.</span></span>—Just as the clouds reveal to us the
          direction of the wind high above our heads, so the lightest and freest spirits
          give signs of future weather by their course. The wind in the
          valley and the market-place opinions of to-day have no significance
          for the future, but only for the past.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>331.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Continual
          Acceleration.</span></span>—Those who begin slowly and find it hard
          to become familiar with a subject, sometimes acquire afterwards the
          quality of continual acceleration—so that in the end no one knows
          where the current will take them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>332.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>The Three Good
          Things.</span></span>—Greatness, calm, sunlight—these three embrace
          all that a thinker desires and also demands of himself: his hopes
          and duties, his claims in the intellectual and moral sphere, nay
          even in his daily manner of life and the scenic background of his
          residence. Corresponding to these three things are, firstly
          thoughts that exalt, secondly thoughts that soothe, and thirdly
          thoughts that illuminate—but, fourthly, thoughts that share in all
          these three qualities, in which all earthly things are
          transfigured. This is the kingdom of the great <em><span>trinity of
          joy</span></em>.</p>

<h2>
<span>333.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Dying
          for</span> <span><span>“</span><span>Truth.</span><span>”</span></span></span>—We should not let
          ourselves be burnt for our opinions—we are not so certain of them
          as all that. But we might let ourselves be burnt for the right of
          possessing and changing our opinions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>334.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Market
          Value.</span></span>—If we wish to pass exactly for what we are, we
          must be something that has its market value. As, however, only
          objects in common use have a market value, this desire is the
          consequence either of shrewd modesty or of stupid immodesty.</p>

<p><span><span>Sophocleanism.</span></span>—Who poured

          time of Sophocles and after. Imitate that whoever can! In life and
          in work!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<span>337.</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Heroism.</span></span>—The heroic
          consists in doing something great (or in nobly <em><span>not</span></em>
          doing something) without feeling oneself to be in competition
          <em><span>with</span></em> or <em><span>before</span></em>
          others. The hero carries with him, wherever he goes, the wilderness

          places we rediscover ourselves, with a delightful shudder: it is
          the pleasantest way of finding our <span>“double.”</span>—How happy must he be who has
          that feeling just
          here, in this perpetually sunny October air, in this happy elfin
          play of the wind from morn till eve, in this clearest of
          atmospheres and mildest of temperatures, in all the serious yet
          cheerful landscape of hill, lake, and forest on this plateau, which
          has encamped fearlessly next to the terrors of eternal snow: here,
          where Italy and Finland have joined hands, and where the home of
          all the silver colour-tones of Nature seems to be established. How
          happy must he be who can say, <span>“True, there
          are many grander and finer pieces of scenery, but this is so

          must put up with being considered, for that very reason, older than
          they are. For men read the handwriting of the intellect as signs of
          <em><span>experience</span></em>—that is, of having
          lived much and evilly, of suffering, error, and repentance. Hence,
          if we are very clever and show it, we appear to them older and
          wickeder than we are.</p>

<p><span><span>How we must
          Conquer.</span></span>—We ought not to desire victory if we only
          have the prospect of overcoming our opponent by a hair's breadth. A
          good victory makes the vanquished rejoice, and must have about it
          something divine which spares <em><span>humiliation</span></em>.</p>

<p><span><span>An Illusion of
          Superior Minds.</span></span>—Superior minds find it difficult to
          free themselves from an illusion; for they imagine that they excite
          envy among the mediocre and are looked upon as exceptions.
          As a matter of fact,
          however, they are looked upon as superfluous, as something that
          would not be missed if it did not exist.</p>

<p><span><span>Demanded by
          Cleanliness.</span></span>—Changing opinions is in some natures as
          much demanded by cleanliness as changing clothes. In the case of
          other natures it is only demanded by vanity.</p>

<p><span><span>Also Worthy of
          a Hero.</span></span>—Here is a hero who did nothing but shake the
          tree as soon as the fruits were ripe. Do you think that too small a
          thing? Well, just look at the tree that he shook.</p>

<p><span><span>Expressing an
          Error Disagreeably.</span></span>—It is not to every one's taste to
          hear truth pleasantly expressed. But let no one at least believe
          that error will become truth if it is disagreeably expressed.</p>

<p><span><span>The Golden
          Maxim.</span></span>—Man has been bound with many chains, in order
          that he may forget to comport himself like an animal. And indeed he has become more
          gentle, more intellectual, more joyous, more meditative than any
          animal. But now he still suffers from having carried his chains so
          long, from having been so long without pure air and free
          movement—these chains, however, are, as I repeat again and again,
          the ponderous and significant errors of moral, religious, and
          metaphysical ideas. Only when the disease of chains is overcome is
          the first great goal reached—the separation of man from the brute.
          At present we stand in the midst of our work of removing the
          chains, and in doing so we need the strictest precautions. Only the
          ennobled man may be granted freedom of spirit; to him alone comes
          the alleviation of life and heals his wounds; he is the first who
          can say that he lives for the sake of joy, with no other aim; in
          any other mouth, his motto of <span>“Peace around
          me and goodwill towards all the most familiar things,”</span> would
          be dangerous.—In this motto for single individuals he is thinking
          of an ancient saying, magnificent and pathetic, which applied to
          all, and has remained standing above all mankind, as a motto and a
          beacon whereby shall perish all who adorn their banner too
          early—the rock on which Christianity foundered. It is not even yet
          time, it seems, for <em><span>all men</span></em> to have the lot of those
          shepherds who saw the heavens lit up above them and heard the
          words: <span>“Peace on earth and goodwill to one
          another among men.”</span>—It is still the age of the
          individual.</p>

<div>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: Of all that you have enunciated, nothing
          pleased me more than one promise: <span>“Ye want
          again to be good neighbours to the most familiar things.”</span>
          This will be to the advantage of us poor shadows too. For do but
          confess that you have hitherto been only too fond of reviling
          us.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: Reviling? But why did you never defend
          yourselves? After all, you were very close to our ears.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: It seemed to us that we were too near you to
          have a right to talk of ourselves.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: What delicacy! Ah, you shadows are
          <span>“better men”</span> than
          we, I can see that.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: And yet you called us <span>“importunate”</span>—us, who know one thing at least
          extremely well: how to be silent and to wait—no Englishman knows it
          better. It is true we are very, very often in the retinue of men,
          but never as their bondsmen. When man shuns light, we shun man—so
          far, at least, we are free.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: Ah, light shuns man far oftener, and then
          also you abandon him.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: It has often pained me to leave you. I am
          eager for knowledge, and much in man has remained obscure to me,
          because I cannot always be in his company. At the price of complete
          knowledge of man I would gladly be your slave.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: Do you know, do I know, whether you would
          not then unwittingly become master instead of slave? Or would remain a slave indeed, but
          would lead a life of humiliation and disgust because you despised
          your master? Let us both be content with freedom such as you have
          enjoyed up to now—you and I! For the sight of a being not free
          would embitter my greatest joys; all that is best would be
          repugnant to me if any one had to share it with me—I will not hear
          of any slaves about me. That is why I do not care for the dog, that
          lazy, tail-wagging parasite, who first became <span>“doggish”</span> as the slave of man, and of whom they
          still say that he is loyal to his master and follows him like——</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: Like his shadow, they say. Perhaps I have
          already followed you too long to-day? It has been the longest day,
          but we are nearing the end; be patient a little more! The grass is
          damp; I am feeling chilly.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: Oh, is it already time to part? And I had
          to hurt you in the end—I saw you became darker.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: I blushed the only colour I have at command.
          I remembered that I had often lain at your feet like a dog, and
          that you then——</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: Can I not with all speed do something to
          please you? Have you no wish?</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: None, except perhaps the wish that the
          philosophic <span>“dog”</span>
          expressed to Alexander the Great—just move a little out of my
          light; I feel cold.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: What am I to do?</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Shadow</span></span>: Walk under those fir-trees and look around
          you towards the mountains; the sun is sinking.</p>
<p><span><span>The
          Wanderer</span></span>: Where are you? Where are you?</p>
